<p>To the Black and Unknown Bards who gave to the world the priceless
treasure of those “canticles of love and woe,” the camp-meeting
Spirituals; more particularly, to those untaught singers of the old
plantations of the South, whose melodious lullabies to the babes of both
races entered with genius-quickening power into the souls of Poe and
Lanier, Dunbar and Cotter: to them, for whom any monument in stone or
bronze were but mockery, I dedicate this monument of verse, budded by
the children of their vision.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p><i>Ad astra per aspera</i>&mdash;that is the old Roman adage. Magnificent is it,
and magnificently is it being in these days exemplified by the American
Negroes, particularly by the increasing number of educated and talented
American Negroes, and most particularly by those who feel the urge to
express in song the emotions and aspirations of their people. A
surprisingly large number is this class. Without exhausting the
possibilities of selection I have quoted in this anthology of
contemporary Negro poetry sixty odd writers of tolerable verse that
exhibits, besides form, at least one fundamental quality of poetry,
namely, passion.</p>

<p>The mere number, large as it is, would of course not signify by itself.
Nor does the phrase “tolerable verse,” cautiously chosen, seem to
promise much. What this multitude means, and whether the verse be worthy
of a more complimentary description, I leave to the reader’s judgment.
Quality of expression and character of content are of course the
prepotent considerations.</p>

<p>While, in a preliminary section, I have passed in review the poetry of
the Negro up to and including Dunbar, not neglecting the old religious
songs of the plantation, or “Spirituals,” and the dance, play, and
nursery rhymes, or “Seculars,” yet strictly speaking this is a
representation of new Negro voices, an anthology of present-day Negro
verse, with biographical items and critical, or at least appreciative
comment.</p>

<p>I wish most heartily to express my obligations to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xiv" id="page_xiv">{xiv}</a></span> publishers and
authors of the volumes I have drawn upon for selections. They are named
in the Index and Biographical and Bibliographical Notes at the end of
the text. But for the reader’s convenience I collect their names here:</p>

<p>To readers who are disposed to study the poetry of the Negro I would
commend Dr. James Weldon Johnson’s <i>The Book of American Negro Poetry</i>
(Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co.) and Mr. Arthur A. Schomburg’s <i>A Bibliographical
Checklist of American Negro Poetry</i> (Charles F. Hartman, New York). I am

<h1>NEGRO POETS AND<br /> THEIR POEMS</h1>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I<br /><br />
<small>THE NEGROES HERITAGE OF SONG</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> an empire may grow up within an empire without observation so a
republic of letters within a republic of letters. That thing is
happening today in this land of ours. A literature of significance on
many accounts, and not without various and considerable merits. Its
producers are Negroes. Culture, talent, genius&mdash;or something very like
it&mdash;are theirs. Nor is it “the mantle of Dunbar” they wrap themselves
in, but an unborrowed singing robe, that better fits “the New Negro.”
The list of names in poetry alone would stretch out, were I to start
telling them over, until I should bring suspicion upon myself as no
trustworthy reporter. Besides, the mere names would mean nothing, since,
as intimated, this little republic has grown up unobserved in our big
one.</p>

<p>It may be more for the promise held forth by their thin little volumes
than for the intrinsic merit of their performance that we should esteem
the verse-makers represented in this survey of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_2" id="page_2">{2}</a></span> contemporary Negro
poetry. Yet on many grounds they should receive candid attention, both
from the students of literature and the students of sociology.
Recognition of real literary merit will be accorded by the one class of
students, and recognition of new aspects of the most serious race
problem of the ages will be forced upon the second class. Justification
enough for the present survey and exhibition will be acknowledged by all
who are earnestly concerned either with literature or with life.</p>

<p>Perhaps, unconsciously, in my comments and estimates I have not
steadfastly kept before me absolute standards of poetry. But where and
when was this ever done? Doubtless in critiques of master poets by
master critics, and only there. In writing of contemporary verse, by
courtesy called poetry, we compromise, our estimates are relative, we
make allowances, our approvals and disapprovals are toned according to
the known circumstances of production. And this is right.</p>

<p>If the prospective reader opens this volume with the demand in his mind
for novelty of language, form, imagery, idea&mdash;novelty and quaintness,
perhaps amusing “originality”, or grotesqueness&mdash;let him reflect how
unreasonable a similar demand on the part of English critics was a
century ago relative to the beginnings of American poetry. Were not
American poets products of the same culture as their contemporaries in
England? What other language had they than the language<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_3" id="page_3">{3}</a></span> of Shakespeare
and Wordsworth, Keats and Tennyson? The same is essentially true of the
American Negro&mdash;or the Negro American, if you choose. He is the heir of
Anglo-Saxon culture, he has been nurtured in the same spiritual soil as
his contemporary of the white race, the same traditions of language,
form, imagery, and idea are his. Everything possible has been done to
stamp out his own African traditions and native propensities. Therefore,
let no unreasonable demand be laid upon these Negro rhymers.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, something distinctive, and something uniquely
significant, may be discerned in these verse productions to reward the
perusal. But this may not be the reader’s chief reward. That may be his
discovery, that, after all, a wonderful likeness rather than unlikeness
to the poetry of other races looks forth from this poetry of the
children of Ham. A valuable result would this be, should it follow.</p>

<p>Before attempting a survey of the field of contemporary verse it will
advantage us to cast a backward glance upon the poetic traditions of the
Negro, to see what is the present-day Negro poet’s heritage of song.
These traditions will be reviewed in two sections: 1. Untaught Melodies;
2. The Poetry of Art. This backward glance will comprehend all that was
sung or written by colored people from Jupiter Hammon to Paul Laurence
Dunbar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4">{4}</a></span></p>

<h3>I. <span class="smcap">Untaught Melodies</span></h3>

<p>The Negro might well be expected to exhibit a gift for poetry. His gift
for oratory has long been acknowledged. The fact has been accepted
without reflection upon its significance. It should have been foreseen
that because of the close kinship between oratory and poetry the Negro
would some day, with more culture, achieve distinction in the latter
art, as he had already achieved distinction in the former art. The
endowments which make for distinction in these two great kindred arts,
it must also be remarked, have not been properly esteemed in the Negro.
In other races oratory and poetry have been accepted as the tokens of
noble qualities of character, lofty spiritual gifts. Such they are, in
all races. They spring from mankind’s supreme spiritual impulses, from
mankind’s loftiest aspirations&mdash;the aspirations for freedom, for
justice, for virtue, for honor and distinction.</p>

<p>That these impulses, these aspirations, and these endowments are in the
American Negro and are now exhibiting themselves in verse&mdash;it is this I
wish to show to the skeptically minded. It will readily be admitted that
the Negro nature is endowed above most others, if not all others, in
fervor of feeling, in the completeness of self-surrender to emotion.
Hence we see that marvelous display of rhythm in the individual and in
the group. This capacity of submission to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5">{5}</a></span> higher harmony, a grander
power, than self, affords the explanation of mankind’s highest reaches
of thought, supreme insights, and noblest expressions. Rhythm is its
manifestation. It is the most central and compulsive law of the
universe. The rhythmic soul falls into harmony and co-operation with the
universal creative energy. It therefore becomes a creative soul. Rhythm
visibly takes hold of the Negro and sways his entire being. It makes him
one with the universal Power that Goethe describes, in famous lines, as
“at the roaring loom of time, weaving for God the garment thou seest him
by.”</p>

<p>But fervor of feeling must have some originating cause. That cause is a
conception&mdash;the vivid, concrete presentation of an object or idea to the
mind. The Negro has this endowment also. Ideas enter his mind with a
vividness and power which betoken an extraordinary faculty of
imagination. The graphic originality of language commonly exhibited by
the Negro would be sufficient proof of this were other proof wanting. No
one will deny to the Negro this gift. Whoever has listened to a colored
preacher’s sermon, either of the old or the new school, will recall
perhaps more than one example of poetic phrasing, more than one
word-picture, that rendered some idea vivid beyond vanishing. It no
doubt has been made, in the ignorant or illiterate, an object of jest,
just as the other two endowments have been; but these three gifts are
the three supreme gifts of the poet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span> and the poet is the supreme
outcome of the race: power of feeling, power of imagination, power of
expression&mdash;and these make the poet.</p>

<h4><i>1. The Spirituals</i></h4>

<p>As a witness of the Negro’s untutored gift for song there are the
Spirituals, his “canticles of love and woe,” chanted wildly, in that
darkness which only a few rays from heaven brightened. Since they
afford, as it were, a background for the song of cultured art which now
begins to appear, I must here give a word to these crude old plantation
songs. They are one of the most notable contributions of any people,
similarly circumstanced, to the world’s treasury of song, altogether the
most appealing. Their significance for history and for art&mdash;more
especially for art&mdash;awaits interpretation. There are signs that this
interpretation is not far in the future. Dvorak, the Bohemian, aided by
the Negro composer, Harry T. Burleigh, may have heralded, in his “New
World Symphony,” the consummate achievement of the future which shall be
entirely the Negro’s. Had Samuel Coleridge-Taylor been an American
instead of an English Negro, this theme rather than the Indian theme
might have occupied his genius&mdash;the evidence whereof is that, removed as
he was from the scenes of plantation life and the tribulations of the
slaves, yet that life and those tribulations<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7">{7}</a></span> touched his heart and
found a place, though a minor one, in his compositions.</p>

<p>But the sister art of poetry may anticipate music in the great feat of
embodying artistically the yearning, suffering, prayerful soul of the
African in those centuries when he could only with patience endure and
trust in God&mdash;and wail these mournfullest of melodies. Some lyrical
drama like “Prometheus Bound,” but more touching as being more human;
some epic like “Paradise Lost,” but nearer to the common heart of man,
and more lyrical; some “Divina Commedia,” that shall be the voice of
those silent centuries of slavery, as Dante’s poem was the voice of the
long-silent epoch preceding it, or some lyrical “passion play” like that
of Oberammergau, is the not improbable achievement of some descendant of
the slaves.</p>

<p>In a poem of tender appeal, James Weldon Johnson has celebrated the
“black and unknown bards,” who, without art, and even without letters,
produced from their hearts, weighed down with sorrows, the immortal
Spirituals:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O black and unknown bards of long ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How came your lips to touch the sacred fire?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How, in your darkness, did you come to know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The power and beauty of the minstrel’s lyre?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who first from midst his bonds lifted his eyes?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who first from out the still watch, lone and long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feeling the ancient faith of prophets rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within his dark-kept soul, burst into song?<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">{8}</a></span></div></div>
</div>

<p>So begins this noble tribute to the nameless natural poets whose hearts,
touched as a harp by the Divine Spirit, gave forth “Swing Low, Sweet
Chariot,” and “Nobody Knows de Trouble I See,” “Steal Away to Jesus,”
and “Roll, Jordan, Roll.”</p>

<p>Great praise does indeed rightly belong to that black slave-folk who
gave to the world this treasure of religious song. To the world, I say,
for they belong as truly to the whole world as do the quaint and
incomparable animal stories of Uncle Remus. Their appeal is to every
human heart, but especially to the heart that has known great sorrow and
which looks to God for help.</p>

<p>It is only of late their meaning has begun to dawn upon us&mdash;their
tragic, heart-searching meaning. Who in hearing these Spirituals sung
to-day by the heirs of their creators can doubt what they meant when
they were wailed in the quarters or shouted in wild frenzy in the
camp-meetings of the slaves? Even the broken, poverty-stricken English
adds infinitely to the pathos:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I’m walking on borrowed land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This world ain’t none of my home.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We’ll stand the storm, it won’t be long.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, walk together children,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Don’t get weary.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My heavenly home is bright and fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor pain nor death can enter there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9">{9}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, steal away and pray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’m looking for my Jesus.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, freedom! oh, freedom! oh, freedom over me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An’ before I’d be a slave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’ll be buried in my grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And go home to my Lord an’ be free.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Not a word here but had two meanings for the slave, a worldly one and a
spiritual one, and only one meaning, the spiritual one, for the
master&mdash;who gladly saw this religious frenzy as an emotional
safety-valve.</p>

<p>In certain aspects these Spirituals suggest the songs of Zion, the
Psalms. Trouble is the mother of song, particularly of religious song.
In trouble the soul cries out to God&mdash;“a very present help in time of
trouble.” The Psalms and the Spirituals alike rise <i>de profundis</i>. But
in one respect the songs of the African slaves differ from the songs of
Israel in captivity: there is no prayer for vengeance in the Spirituals,
no vindictive spirit ever even suggested. We can but wonder now at this.
For slavery at its best was degrading, cruel, and oppressive. Yet no
imprecation, such as mars so many a beautiful Psalm, ever found its way
into a plantation Spiritual. A convincing testimony this to that spirit
in the African slave which Christ, by precept and example, sought to
establish in His disciples. If the Negro in our present day is growing
bitter toward the white race, it behooves us to inquire why it is so, in
view of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10">{10}</a></span> indisputable patience, meekness, and good-nature. We might
find in our present régime a more intolerable cruelty than belonged even
to slavery, if we investigated honestly. There is certainly a bitter and
vindictive tone in much of the Afro-American verse now appearing in the
colored press. For both races it augurs ill.</p>

<p>But I have not yet indicated the precise place of these Spirituals in
the world’s treasury of song. They have a close kinship with the Psalms
but a yet closer one with the chanted prayers of the primitive
Christians, the Christians when they were the outcasts of the Roman
Empire when to be a Christian was to be a martyr. In secret places, in
catacombs, they sent up their triumphant though sorrowful songs, they
chanted their litanies</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">“&mdash;that came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the volcano’s tongue of flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up from the burning core below&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The canticles of love and woe.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>So indeed came the Spirituals of the African slave. These songs might in
truth, to use a figure of the old poets, be called the melodious tears
of those who wailed them. An African proverb says, “We weep in our
hearts like the tortoise.” In their hearts&mdash;so wept the slaves, silently
save for these mournful cries in melody. Without means of defense, save
a nature armored with faith, when assailed, insulted, oppressed, they
could but imitate the tortoise when he shuts himself up in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11">{11}</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ill_002" id="ill_002"></a>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12">{12}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">shell and patiently takes the blows that fall. The world knew not then,
nor fully knows now&mdash;partly because of African buoyancy, pliability, and
optimism&mdash;what tears they wept. These Spirituals are the golden vials
spoken of in Holy Writ, “full of odors, which are the prayers of
saints”&mdash;an everlasting memorial before the throne of God. Other vials
there are, different from these, and they, too, are at God’s right hand.</p>

<p>A Negro sculptor, Mrs. Meta Warrick Fuller, not knowing of this proverb
about the tortoise which has only recently been brought from Africa, but
simply interpreting Negro life in America, has embodied the very idea of
the African saying in bronze. Under the title “Secret Sorrow” a man is
represented as eating his own heart.</p>

<p>The interpretation in art of the Spirituals, or a poetry of art
developed along the lines and in the spirit of those songs, is something
we may expect the black singers of no distant day to produce. Already we
have many a poem that offers striking reminiscences of them.</p>

<h4><i>2. The Seculars</i></h4>

<p>But other songs the Negro has which are more noteworthy from the point
of view of art than the Spirituals: songs that are richer in artistic
effects, more elaborate in form, more varied and copious in expression.
These are the Negro’s secular songs and rhymes, his dance, play, and
love-making songs, his gnomic and nursery<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13" id="page_13">{13}</a></span> rhymes.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It is not
exaggeration to say that in rhythmic and melodic effects they surpass
any other body of folk-verse whatsoever. In wit, wisdom, and quaint
turns of humor no other folk-rhymes equal them. Prolific, too, in such
productions the race seems to have been, since so many at this late day
were to be found.</p>

<p>It comes not within the scope of this anthology to include any of these
folk-rhymes of the elder day, but a few specimens seem necessary to
indicate to the young Negro who would be a poet his rich heritage of
song and to the white reader what essentially poetic traits the Negro
has by nature. It was “black and unknown bards,” slaves, too, who sang
or said these rhymes:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh laugh an’ sing an’ don’t git tired.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We’s all gwine home, some Mond’y,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To de honey pond an’ fritter trees;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An’ ev’ry day’ll be Sund’y.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Pride, too, and a sense of values had the Negro, bond or free:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My name’s Ran, I wuks in de san’;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Gwinter hitch my oxes side by side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An’ take my gal fer a big fine ride.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>After a description of anticipated pleasures and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_14" id="page_14">{14}</a></span> a comic interlude in
dialogue, the ballad from which these two couplets are taken concludes
with that varied repetition of the first stanza which we find so
effective in the poems of art:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I’d druther be a Nigger, an’ plow ole Beck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dan a white Hill Billy wid his long red neck.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Song or rhyme was, as ever, heart’s ease to the Negro in every trouble.
Here are two rhymes that “pack up” and put away two common troubles:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She writ me a letter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As long as my eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An’ she say in dat letter:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“My Honey!&mdash;Good-by!”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<span class="i0">It up an’ say: “Farewell!”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Going to the nursery&mdash;it was the one room of the log cabin, or the great
out-of-doors&mdash;we find the old-time Negro’s head filled with a <i>Mother
Goose</i> more enchanting than any printed and pictured one in the “great
house” of the white child:</p>

<p>But it is in the dance songs that rhythm in its perfection makes itself
felt and that repetends are employed with effects which another Poe or
Lanier might appropriate for supreme art. A lively scene and gay
frolicsome movements are conjured up by the following dance songs:</p>

<p class="cpom">CHICKEN IN THE BREAD TRAY</p>

<p>Out of the pastime group I take a rhyme that is typically full of
character, delicious in its wit and proverbial lore:</p>

<p class="cpom">FATTENING FROGS FOR SNAKES</p>

<div class="poetry">

</div>

<p>In the love songs one finds that mingling of pathos and humor so
characteristic of the Negro. The one example I shall give lacks nothing
of art&mdash;some unknown Dunbar, some black Bobbie Burns, must have composed
it:</p>

<p class="cpom">SHE HUGGED ME AND KISSED ME</p>

<p>In a very striking way these folk-songs of the plantation suggest the
old English folk-songs of unknown authorship and origin&mdash;the ancient
traditional ballads, long despised and neglected, but ever living on and
loved in the hearts of the people. This unstudied poetry of the people,
the unlettered common folk, had supreme virtues, the elemental and
universal virtues of simplicity, sincerity, veracity. It had the power,
in an artificial age, to bring poetry back to reality, to genuine
emotion, to effectiveness, to the common interests of mankind. Simple
and crude as it was it had a merit unknown to the polished verse of the
schools. Potential Negro poets might do well to ponder this fact of
literary history. There is nothing more precious in English literature
than this crude old poetry of the people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_19" id="page_19">{19}</a></span></p>

<p>There is a book of rhymes which, every Christmas season, is the favorite
gift, the most gladly received, of all that Santa Claus brings. Nor so
at Christmas only; it is a perennial pleasure, a boon to all children,
young and old in years. This book is <i>Mother Goose’s Melodies</i>. How many
“immortal” epics of learned poets it has outlived! How many dainty
volumes of polished lyrics has this humble book of “rhymes” seen vanish
to the dusty realms of dark oblivion! In every home it has a place and
is cherished. Its contents are better known and more loved than the
contents of any other book. Untutored, nameless poets, nature-inspired,
gave this priceless boon to all generations of children, and to all
sorts and conditions&mdash;an immortal book. As a life-long teacher and
student of poetry, I venture, with no fear, the assertion that from no
book of verse in our language can the whole art of poetry be so
effectively learned as from <i>Mother Goose’s Melodies</i>. Every device of
rhyme, and melody, and rhythm, and tonal color is exemplified here in a
manner to produce the effects which all the great artists in verse aim
at. This book that we all love&mdash;and patronize&mdash;is the greatest melodic
triumph in the white man’s literature.</p>

<p>Of like merit and certainly no less are the folk rhymes and songs, both
the Spirituals and the Seculars, of the Negro. Their art potentialities
are immense. Well may the aspirant to fame in poetry put these songs in
his memory and peruse<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_20" id="page_20">{20}</a></span> them as Burns did the old popular songs of
Scotland, to make them yield suggestions of songs at the highest reach
of art.</p>

<h3>II. <span class="smcap">The Poetry of Art</span></h3>

<p>But another heritage of song, not so crude nor yet so precious as the
Spirituals and the Folk Rhymes has the Negro of to-day. That heritage
comes from enslaved and emancipated men and women who by some means or
another learned to write and publish their compositions. Although the
intrinsic value of this heritage of song cannot be rated high, yet,
considering the circumstances of its production, the colored people of
America may well take pride in it. Its incidental value can hardly be
overestimated. In it is the most infallible record we have of the
Negro’s inner life in bondage and in the years following emancipation.
Never broken was the tradition from Jupiter Hammon and Phillis Wheatley,
in the last half of the eighteenth century, to Paul Laurence Dunbar and
Joseph Seamon Cotter, in the end of the nineteenth, but constantly
enriched by an increasing number of men and women who sought in the form
of verse a record of their sufferings and yearnings, consolations and
hopes.</p>

<h4><i>1. Jupiter Hammon and Phillis Wheatley</i></h4>

<p>Jupiter Hammon was the first American Negro poet of whom any record
exists. His first extant<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_21" id="page_21">{21}</a></span> poem, “An Evening Thought,” bears the date of
1760, preceding therefore any poem by Phillis Wheatley, his
contemporary, by nine years. Following the title of the poem this
information is given: “Composed by Jupiter Hammon, a Negro belonging to
Mr. Lloyd, of Queen’s Village, on Long Island, the 25th of December,
1760.” With this poem of eighty-eight rhyming lines, printed on a
double-column broadside, entered the American Negro into American
literature. For that reason alone, were his stanzas inferior to what
they are, I should include some of them in this anthology. But the truth
is that, as “religious” poetry goes, or went in the eighteenth
century&mdash;and Hammon’s poetry is all religious&mdash;this Negro slave may hold
up his head in almost any company.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the reader must not expect poetry in the typical stanzas I
shall quote, but just some remarkable rhyming for an African slave,
untaught and without precedent. “An Evening Thought” runs in such
stanzas as the following:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dear Jesus give thy Spirit now,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy Grace to every Nation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That han’t the Lord to whom we bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Author of Salvation.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>From “An Address to Miss Phillis Wheatley, Ethiopian Poetess,” I take
the following as a representative stanza:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22">{22}</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">While thousands muse with earthly toys,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And range about the street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dear Phillis, seek for heaven’s joys,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where we do hope to meet.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>“A Poem for Children, with Thoughts on Death,” contains such stanzas as
this:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">’Tis God alone can make you wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His wisdom’s from above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He fills the soul with sweet supplies<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By his redeeming love.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Two stanzas from “A Dialogue, Entitled, The Kind Master and the Dutiful
Servant,” will show how that poem runs:</p>

<p class="cpom">MASTER</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then will the happy day appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That virtue shall increase;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay up the sword and drop the spear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Nations seek for peace.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="cpom">SERVANT</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then shall we see the happy end,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Tho’ still in some distress;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That distant foes shall act like friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And leave their wickedness.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_23" id="page_23">{23}</a></span></div></div>
</div>

<p>Jupiter Hammon’s birth and death dates are uncommemorated because
unknown. Unknown, too, is his grave. But to his memory, no less than to
that of Crispus Attucks, there should somewhere be erected a monument.</p>

<div class="figright"><a name="ill_004" id="ill_004"></a>
<a href="images/i_023_lg.jpg">
<img src="images/i_023_sml.jpg" alt="[Image unavailable.]" /></a>
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Phillis Wheatley</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Since Stedman included in his <i>Library of American Literature</i> a picture
of Phillis Wheatley and specimens of her verse, a few white persons,
less than scholars and more than general readers, knew, when Dunbar
appeared, that there had been at least one poetic predecessor in his
race. But the long stretch between the slave-girl rhymer of Boston and
the elevator-boy singer of Dayton was desert. They knew not of George
Moses Horton of North Carolina, who found publication for <i>Poems by a
Slave</i> in 1829, and <i>Poetical Works</i> in 1845. Horton, who learned to
write by his own efforts, is said to have been so fond of poetry that he
would pick up any chance scraps of paper he saw, hoping to find verses.
They knew not of Ann Plato,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_24" id="page_24">{24}</a></span> of Hartford, Connecticut, a slave girl who
published a book of twenty poems in 1841; nor of Frances Ellen Watkins
(afterwards Harper) whose <i>Poems on Miscellaneous Subjects</i> appeared in
1857, reaching a circulation of ten thousand copies; nor of Charles L.
Reason, whose poem entitled <i>Freedom</i>, published in 1847, voiced the cry
of millions of fellow blacks in bonds.</p>

<h4><i>2. Charles L. Reason</i></h4>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 272px;"><a name="ill_005" id="ill_005"></a>
<a href="images/i_024_lg.jpg">
<img src="images/i_024_sml.jpg" width="272" height="340" alt="[Image unavailable.]" /></a>
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Charles L. Reason</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Thus bursts forth Reason’s poetic cry, not unlike that of the crude
Spirituals:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O Freedom! Freedom! Oh, how oft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy loving children call on Thee!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In wailings loud and breathings soft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beseeching God, Thy face to see.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With agonizing hearts we kneel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While ’round us howls the oppressor’s cry,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And suppliant pray that we may feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ennobling glances of Thine eye.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_25" id="page_25">{25}</a></span></div></div>
</div>

<p>The apostrophe continues through forty-two stanzas, commemorating, with
appreciative knowledge of history, the countries, battle fields, and
heroes associated with the advance of freedom. After an arraignment of
civil rulers and a recreant priesthood, the learned and noble apostrophe
thus concludes:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, purify each holy court!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ministry of law and light!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That man no longer may be bought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To trample down his brother’s right.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We lift imploring hands to Thee!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We cry for those in prison bound!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, in Thy strength come! Liberty!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ’stablish right the wide world round.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We pray to see Thee, face to face:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To feel our souls grow strong and wide:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So ever shall our injured race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Thy firm principles abide.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<h4><i>3. George Moses Horton</i></h4>

<p>By some means or other, self-guided, the North Carolina slave, George
Moses Horton, learned to read and write. His first book, <i>Poems by a
Slave</i>, appeared in 1829, and other books followed until 1865. Like
Hammon, and true to his race, Horton is religious, and, like Reason, and
again true to his race, he loves freedom. I choose but a few stanzas to
illustrate his quality as a poet:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_26" id="page_26">{26}</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Alas! and am I born for this,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To wear this slavish chain?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deprived of all created bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through hardship, toil, and pain?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How long have I in bondage lain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And languished to be free!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! and must I still complain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Deprived of liberty?<br /></span>
<span class="ispc">****<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, Liberty! thou cheerful sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Roll through my ravished ears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, let my grief in joys be drowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And drive away my fears.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<h4><i>4. Frances Ellen Watkins Harper</i></h4>

<p>A female poet of the same period as Horton wrote in the same strain
about freedom:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Make me a grave wher’er you will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a lowly plain or a lofty hill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make it among earth’s humblest graves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not in a land where men are slaves.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Like Horton, she lived to see her prayer for freedom answered. Of the
Emancipation Proclamation she burst forth in joy:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It shall flash through coming ages,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It shall light the distant years;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And eyes now dim with sorrow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shall be brighter through their tears.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>This slave woman was Frances Ellen Watkins, by marriage Harper. Mrs.
Harper attained to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27" id="page_27">{27}</a></span> greater popularity than any poet of her race prior
to Dunbar. As many as ten thousand copies of some of her poems were in
circulation in the middle of the last century. Her success was not
unmerited. Many singers of no greater merit have enjoyed greater
celebrity. She was thoroughly in the fashion of her times, as Phillis
Wheatley was in the yet prevalent fashion of Pope, or, perhaps more
accurately, Cowper. The models in the middle of the nineteenth century
were Mrs. Hemans, Whittier, and Longfellow. It is in their manner she
writes. A serene and beautiful Christian spirit tells a moral tale in
fluent ballad stanzas, not without poetic phrasing. In all she beholds,
in all she experiences, there is a lesson. There is no grief without its
consolation. Serene resignation breathes through all her poems&mdash;at least
through those written after her freedom was achieved. Illustrations of
these traits abound. A few stanzas from <i>Go Work in My Vineyard</i> will
suffice. After bitter disappointments in attempting to fulfil the
command the “lesson” comes thus sweetly expressed:</p>

<p>How successfully Mrs. Harper could draw a lesson from the common objects
or occurrences of the world about us may be illustrated by the following
poem:</p>

<p class="cpom">TRUTH</p>

<span class="i0">When angry storms around him prest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Morn, springing from the arms of night,<br /></span>

<p>Those last stanzas are quite as noble as any that one may find in the
poets whom I named as setting the American fashion in the era of Mrs.
Harper. The poems of this gentle, sweet-spirited Negro woman deserve a
better fate than has overtaken them.</p>

<h4><i>5. James Madison Bell and Albery A. Whitman</i></h4>

<p>Although this is not a history of American Negro poetry, yet a brief
notice must be given at this point to two other writers too important to
be omitted even from a swift survey like the present one. They are J.
Madison Bell and Albery A. Whitman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_33" id="page_33">{33}</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">James Madison Bell</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Bell, anti-slavery orator and friend of John Brown’s, was a prolific
writer of eloquent verse. His original endowments were considerable.
Denied an education in boyhood, he learned a trade and in manhood at
night-schools gained access to the wisdom of books. He became a master
of expression both with tongue and pen. His long period of productivity
covers the history of his people from the decade before Emancipation
till the death of Dunbar. Bell’s themes are lofty and he writes with
fervid eloquence. There is something of Byronic power in the roll of his
verse. An extract from <i>The Progress of Liberty</i> will be representative,
though an extract cannot show either the maintenance of power or the
abundance of resources:</p>

<div class="poetry">

<span class="i0">No tyrant’s power can crush the soul<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Illumed by thine inspiring ray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fiendishness of base control<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Whitman, a younger contemporary of Bell’s, is the author of several long
tales in verse. Like Bell, he wrote only in standard English, and like
him also, shows a mastery of expression, with fluency of style, wealth
of imagery, and a command of the forms of verse given vogue by Scott and
Byron. Both likewise write fervently of the wrongs suffered by the black
man at the hands of the white. Thus far they resemble; but if we extend
the comparison we note important differences. Bell has more of the
fervor of the orator and the sense of fact of the historian. He adheres
closely to events and celebrates occasions. Whitman invents tragic tales
of love and romance, clothing them with the charm of the South and
infusing into them the pathos which results from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_36" id="page_36">{36}</a></span> the strife of thwarted
passions, the defeat of true love.</p>

<p>A stanza or two from Whitman’s <i>An Idyl of the South</i> will exemplify his
qualities. The hero of this pathetic tale is a white youth of
aristocratic parentage, the heroine is an octoroon. He is thus
described:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He was of manly beauty&mdash;brave and fair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was the Norman iron in his blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was the Saxon in his sunny hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That waved and tossed in an abandoned flood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Norman strength rose in his shoulders square,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so, as manfully erect he stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Norse gods might read the likeness of their race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his proud bearing and patrician face.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The heroine is thus portrayed:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A lithe and shapely beauty; like a deer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She looked in wistfulness, and from you went;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With silken shyness shrank as if in fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kept the distance of the innocent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, when alone, she bolder would appear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then all her being into song was sent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bound in cascades&mdash;ripple, whirl, and gleam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A headlong torrent in a crystal stream.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Only tragedy, under the conditions, could result from their mutual
fervent love. The poet does not moralize but in a figure intimates the
sadness induced by the tale:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The hedges may obscure the sweetest bloom&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The orphan of the waste&mdash;the lowly flower;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_37" id="page_37">{37}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">While in the garden, faint for want of room,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The splendid failure pines within her bower.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is a wide republic of perfume,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which the nameless waifs of sun and shower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That scatter wildly through the fields and woods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make the divineness of the solitudes.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>After such a manner wrote those whom we may call bards of an elder day.</p>

<h4><i>6. Paul Laurence Dunbar</i></h4>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He came, a dark youth, singing in the dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a new freedom, glowing o’er his lyre,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Refining, as with great Apollo’s fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His people’s gift of song. And, thereupon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This Negro singer, come to Helicon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Constrained the masters, listening, to admire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And roused a race to wonder and aspire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazing which way their honest voice was gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ebon face uplit of glory’s crest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men marveled at the singer, strong and sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who brought the cabin’s mirth, the tuneful night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But faced the morning, beautiful with light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To die while shadows yet fell toward the west,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leave his laurels at his people’s feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">&mdash;<i>James David Corrothers.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Less than a generation ago William Dean Howells hailed Paul Laurence
Dunbar as “the first instance of an American Negro who had evinced
innate distinction in literature,” “the only man of pure African blood
and of American civilization to feel Negro life æsthetically and express
it<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_38" id="page_38">{38}</a></span> lyrically.” It is not my purpose to give Dunbar space and
consideration in this book commensurate with his importance. Its scope
does not, strictly speaking, include him and his predecessors. They are
introduced here, but to provide an historical background. The object of
this book is to exhibit the achievement of the Negro in verse since
Dunbar. Even though it were true, which I think it is not, that no
American Negro previous to Dunbar had evinced innate distinction in
literature, this anthology, I believe, will reveal that many American
Negroes in this new day are evincing, if not innate distinction, yet
cultured talent, in literature.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 201px;"><a name="ill_008" id="ill_008"></a>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Paul Laurence Dunbar</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The sonnet to Dunbar which stands at the head of this section was
composed by a Negro who was by three years Dunbar’s senior. His
opportunities in early life were far inferior to Dunbar’s. At nineteen
years of age, with almost inconsiderable schooling, he was a boot-black
in a Chicago barber shop. I give his sonnet here&mdash;other poems<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_39" id="page_39">{39}</a></span> of his I
give in another chapter&mdash;in evidence of that distinction in literature,
innate or otherwise, which is rather widespread among American Negroes
of the present time. Dunbar himself might have been proud to put his
name to this sonnet.</p>

<p>When this marvel, a Negro poet, so vouched for, appeared in the West,
like a new star in the heavens, a few white people, a very few, knew,
vaguely, that back in Colonial times there was a slave woman in Boston
who had written verses, who was therefore a prodigy. The space between
Phillis Wheatley and this new singer was desert. But Nature, as people
think, produces freaks, or sports; therefore a Negro poet was not
absolutely beyond belief, since poets are rather freakish, abnormal
creatures anyway. Incredulity therefore yielded to an attitude scarcely
worthier, namely, that dishonoring, irreverent interpretation of a
supreme human phenomenon which consists in denominating it a freak of
nature. But Dunbar is a fact, as Burns, as Whittier, as Riley, are
facts&mdash;a fact of great moment to a people and for a people. For one
thing, he revealed to the Negro youth of America the latent literary
powers and the unexploited literary materials of their race. He was the
fecundating genius of their talents. Upon all his people he was a
tremendously quickening power, not less so than his great contemporary
at Tuskegee. Doubtless it will be recognized, in a broad view, that the
Negro people<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_40" id="page_40">{40}</a></span> of America needed, equally, both men, the counterparts of
each other.</p>

<p>It needs to be remarked for white people, that there were two Dunbars,
and that they know but one. There is the Dunbar of “the jingle in a
broken tongue,” whom Howells with gracious but imperfect sympathy and
understanding brought to the knowledge of the world, and whom the public
readers, white and black alike, have found it delightful to present, to
the entire eclipse of the other Dunbar. That other Dunbar was the poet
of the flaming “Ode to Ethiopia,” the pathetic lyric, “We Wear the
Mask,” the apparently offhand jingle but real masterpiece entitled
“Life,” the incomparable ode “Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary
eyes,” and a score of other pieces in which, using their speech, he
matches himself with the poets who shine as stars in the firmament of
our admiration. This Dunbar Howells failed to appreciate, and ignorance
of him has been fostered, as I have intimated, by professional readers
and writers. The first Dunbar, the generally accepted one, was, as
Howells pointed out, the artistic interpreter of the old-fashioned,
vanishing generation of black folk&mdash;the generation that was maimed and
scarred by slavery, that presented so many ludicrous and pathetic,
abject and lovable aspects in strange mixture. The second Dunbar was the
prophet robed in a mantle of austerity, shod with fire, bowed with
sorrow, as every true prophet has been, in whatever time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_41" id="page_41">{41}</a></span> among
whatever people. He was the prophet, I say, of a new generation, a
coming generation, as he was the poet of a vanishing generation. The
generation of which he was the prophet-herald has arrived. Its most
authentic representatives are the poets that I put forward in this
volume as worthy of attention.</p>

<p>Dunbar’s real significance to his race has been admirably expressed not
only by Corrothers but in the following lines by his biographer, Lida
Keck Wiggins:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Life’s lowly were laureled with verses<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And sceptered were honor and worth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While cabins became, through the poet,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fair homes of the lords of the earth.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>So it was. But “honor and worth” yet remain, to be “sceptered.” Such
poems as these few here given from the choragus of the present
generation of Negro singers will suggest the kind of honor and the
degree of worth to which our tribute is due.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<h4><i>7. J. Mord Allen</i></h4>

<p>In the year of Dunbar’s death (1906), J. Mord Allen published his
<i>Rhymes, Tales, and Rhymed Tales</i>. The contents are mainly in dialect,
dialect that possesses, as it seems to me, every merit of that medium.
There is great felicity of characterization, surprising turns of wit,
quaint philosophy. In a later chapter I will give a specimen of Mr.
Allen’s dialect verse, here two standard English poems. In both mediums
his credentials are authentic, no whit less so than even Dunbar’s. Only
the question arises why his muse became silent after this one
utterance&mdash;for he was at the time but thirty-one years old. Perhaps
poetry did not go with boiler-making, his occupation. Because of the
date of his one book I place him here with Dunbar, and there are yet
other reasons.</p>

<p>Mr. Allen affords but two standard English poems, the first and the last
of his book. Such a fact marks him as of the elder day, though that day
be less than a score of years agone. The concluding poem of his book has
a sweet sadness that must appeal to every heart whose childhood is
getting to be far away:</p>

<p class="cpom">COUNTING OUT</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Eeny meeny miny mo.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, how the sad-sweet Long Ago<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Was full of romping children&mdash;say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What was the game we used to play?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes! Hide-and-seek. And at the base,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who first must go and hide his face?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remember&mdash;standing in a row&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Eeny meeny miny mo”?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Eeny meeny miny mo.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How fare we children here below?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our moon is far from treetops now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Heaven isn’t up, somehow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more for sport play we “I spy”;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our “laying low” and “peeping high”.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are now with consequences fraught;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There’s black disgrace in being caught.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But what’s to pay the pains we take?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let’s play the game for its own sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, ere ’tis time to homeward flit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let’s get some pleasure out of it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For death will soon count down the row,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Eeny meeny miny mo.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Though of the elder day yet Allen is, like Dunbar, a herald of the
generation that is now articulate. In this rôle of herald to a more
self-assertive generation, a more aspiring and race-conscious one, he
speaks with immense significance to us in this first poem of his book,
which, as being prophetic of much we now see in the colored folk<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_50" id="page_50">{50}</a></span> of
America I permit to close this summary review of earlier Negro poetry:</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II<br /><br />
<small>THE PRESENT RENAISSANCE OF THE NEGRO</small></h2>

<h4><i>I. A Glance at the Field</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> are the forms of expression that the life of a developing people or
group finds for itself&mdash;business and wealth, education and culture,
political and social unrest and agitation, literature and art. It can
scarcely happen that any people or group has a vital significance for
other peoples or groups, or any real potency, until it begins to express
itself in poetry. When, however, a race or a portion of our common race
begins to embody its aspirations, its grievances, its animating spirit
in song the world may well take notice. That race or portion of our
common race has within it an unreckoned potency of good and evil&mdash;evil
if the good be thwarted.</p>

<p>It is not, then, to editorials and speeches and sermons, nor to
petitions, protests, and resolutions, but to poems that the wise will
turn in order to learn the temper and permanent bent of mind of a
people. Witness the recent history of Ireland. Her literary renascence
preceded her effective political agitation. The political agitation
which resulted in her independence was the work of poets. The real life
of a people finds its only ade<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_52" id="page_52">{52}</a></span>quate record in song. All of a people’s
history that is permanently or profoundly significant is distilled into
poetry.</p>

<p>It is to the unknown poetry of a despised and rejected people that I
call attention in these pages. One of this people’s poets sings:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We have fashioned laughter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of tears and pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the moment after&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pain and tears again.<br /></span>
<span class="i8"><i>Charles Bertram Johnson.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">And when he so sings we know there is one race above all others which
these words describe. Another sings:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I will suppose that fate is just,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will suppose that grief is wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will tread what path I must<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To enter Paradise.<br /></span>
<span class="i8"><i>Joseph S. Cotter, Sr.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">And when he so sings we know out of what tribulations his resignation
has been born. The resolution of despair cries out in the lines of
another:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My life were lost if I should keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hope-forlorn and gloomy face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brood upon my ills, and weep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mourn the travail of my race.<br /></span>
<span class="i8"><i>Leslie Pinckney Hill.</i><br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_53" id="page_53">{53}</a></span></div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">Another singer, coming out of the Black Belt of the lower South, records
the daily and life-long history of his people in these lines:</p>

<p class="cpom">IT’S ALL THROUGH LIFE</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A day of joy, a week of pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sunny day, a week of rain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A day of peace, a year of strife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But cling to Him, it’s all through life.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">An hour of joy, a day of fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An hour of smiles, a day of tears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An hour of gain, a day of strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Press on, press on, it’s all through life.<br /></span>
<span class="i8"><i>Waverley Turner Carmichael.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In the poetry which the Negro is producing to-day there is a challenge
to the world. His race has been deeply stirred by recent events; its
reaction has been mighty. The challenge, spoken by one, but for the
race, the inarticulate millions as well as the cultured few, comes thus:</p>

<p class="cpom">TO AMERICA</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How would you have us&mdash;as we are,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or sinking ’neath the load we bear?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our eyes fixed forward on a star?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or gazing empty at despair?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_54" id="page_54">{54}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rising or falling? Men or things?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With dragging pace, or footsteps fleet?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strong, willing sinews in your wings?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or tightening chains about your feet?<br /></span>
<span class="i8"><i>James Weldon Johnson.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">With slight regard for smooth words another declares his grievances,
that all may understand:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yes, I am lynched. Is it that I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must without judge or jury die?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though innocent, am I accursed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To quench the mob’s blood-thirsty thirst?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yes, I am mocked. Pray tell me why!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did not my brothers freely die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For you, and your Democracy&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That each and all alike be free?<br /></span>
<span class="i8"><i>Raymond Garfield Dandridge.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">So runs the dominant note of this poetry. But it would be unjust to the
race producing it to convey the idea that this is the only note. The
harp of Ethiopia has many strings and the brothers of Memnon are many.
Sometimes the note is one of simple beauty, like that of a wild rose
blossoming by the wayside. No reader could tell what race produced such
a lyric as the one following, but any reader responsive to the beauty of
art and to the truth of passion would assert its excellence:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I will hide my soul and its mighty love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the bosom of this rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And its dispensing breath will take<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My love wherever it goes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_55" id="page_55">{55}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And perhaps she’ll pluck this very rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, quick as blushes start,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will breathe my hidden secret in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her unsuspecting heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i8"><i>George Marion McClellan.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In a Negro magazine one may chance upon a sonnet that the best poet of
our times might have signed and feared no loss to his reputation, nor
would there be any mark of race in its lines. To candid judgment I
submit the following, from Mrs. Alice Dunbar-Nelson:</p>

<p class="cpom">VIOLETS</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I had not thought of violets of late,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wild, shy kind that spring beneath your feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In wistful April days, when lovers mate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wander through the fields in raptures sweet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thoughts of violets meant florists’ shops,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bows and pins, and perfumed papers fine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And garish lights, and mincing little fops,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cabarets and songs, and deadening wine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So far from sweet real things my thoughts had strayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had forgot wide fields and clear brown streams;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The perfect loveliness that God has made&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wild violets shy and Heaven-mounting dreams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now unwittingly, you’ve made me dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of violets, and my soul’s forgotten gleam.<br /></span>

<p>It needs not that a poet write an epic to prove himself chosen of the
muse. The winds of time<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_56" id="page_56">{56}</a></span> may blow into oblivion all but five lines of an
<i>opus magnum</i>, in which five lines alone was the laborious author a
poet. Wise is the poet who writes but the five lines, as here:</p>

<p class="cpom">SUNSET</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Since Poets have told of sunset,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is left for me to tell?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I can only say that I saw the day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Press crimson lips to the horizon gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kiss the earth farewell.<br /></span>
<span class="i8"><i>Mary Effie Lee.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The theme may be as old as man and as common as humanity yet it can be
made to be felt as poetic by one who has the magic gift, as here:</p>

<p class="cpom">LONELINESS</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I cannot make my thoughts stay home;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I cannot close their door;<br /></span>

<p>One’s find may be in <i>The Poet’s Ingle</i> of a newspaper, where an unknown
name is attached to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_57" id="page_57">{57}</a></span> verses that have the charm which Longfellow found
in the simple and heartfelt lays of the humbler poet. From such a poem,
entitled <i>To My Grandmother</i>, by Mae Smith Johnson, I take two stanzas,
the first two as beautiful as the theme evoked:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You ’mind me of the winter’s eve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When low the sinking sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Casts soft bright rays upon the snow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And day, now almost done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In silence deep prepares to leave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And calmly waits the signal “Go.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Your eyes are faded vestal lights<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That once the hearth illumed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where vestal virgins vigil kept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And budding virtue bloomed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like stars that beam on summer nights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your eyes, by joy and sorrow swept.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Less beautiful, less original, but in another way not less appealing,
are these stanzas, also signed by an unknown name and taken from the
Christmas number of a newspaper. They are the last stanzas but one of a
poem entitled <i>The Child Is Found</i>, by Charles H. Este:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O hearts that mourn and sorrow so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That doubt the power of God,<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>Pride of race, no less than grief for wrongs endured, is one of the
notes of this living verse. Eulogies of the men and women who have lived
heroically for their people, giving vision, quickening aspiration,
opening roads of advance, find a place in every volume of verse and in
the pages of newspapers. Few white persons perhaps have paused to
reflect how noteworthy this traditionary store of heroic names really is
and how potent it is with the people inheriting it. Both practical and
poetic uses&mdash;if these two things are different&mdash;it has. One cannot
foretell to what reflections upon life the eulogist will be led ere he
concludes. From an ode to Booker T. Washington, by Roscoe Riley Dungee,
I take a stanza, by way of illustration:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet, virtue walks a path obscure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And honor struggles to endure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While arrogance and deeds impure<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Adorn the Hall of Fame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still, power triumphs over right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wrong is victor in the fight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Greed, graft, and knavery excite<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Vociferous acclaim.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>It has become evident to those who have seriously studied the
present-day life of the Negroes<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_59" id="page_59">{59}</a></span> that there has been in these recent
years a renascence of the Negro soul. Poetry, as these pages will show,
is one of its modes of expression. Other expressions there are, very
significant ones, too, expressions which are material, tangible,
expressible in figures. Not of this kind is poetry. Yet of all forms
whereby the soul of a people expresses itself the most potent, the most
effective, is poetry. The re-born soul of the Negro is following the
tradition of all races in all times by pouring itself into that form of
words which embodies the most of passionate thought and feeling.</p>

<p>Out of the very heart of a race of twelve million people amongst us
comes this cry which a Negro poet of Virginia utters as</p>

<p class="cpom">A PRAYER OF THE RACE THAT GOD MADE BLACK</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We would be peaceful, Father&mdash;but, when we must,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Help us to thunder hard the blow that’s just!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">We would be prayerful: Lord, when we have prayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us arise courageous&mdash;unafraid!<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We would be all that Thou hast meant for man,<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>Too confidently, as we may learn, have we of the other race relied upon
the Negro’s innate optimism to keep him a safe citizen and a
long-suffering servant. That optimism, that gaiety and buoyancy of
spirit, if not indestructible in the African soul, is yet reducible to
the vanishing point. There are signs of something quite different in the
attitude of Negroes toward their white neighbors to-day. In their poetry
this reputed optimism, where it exists, is found in union with a note of
melancholy or of bitter complaint. A characteristic utterance of this
mood I find in a poem entitled “The Optimist,” from which I will give
one-third of its stanzas:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Never mind, children, be patient awhile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And carry your load with a nod and a smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For out of the hell and the hard of it all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time is sure to bring sweetest honey&mdash;not gall.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Out of the hell and the hard of it all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bright star shall rise that never shall fall:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A God-fearing race&mdash;proud, noble, and true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Giving good for the evil which they always knew.<br /></span>
<span class="ispc">****<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_61" id="page_61">{61}</a></span>
<span class="i0">So dry your wet pillow and lift your bowed head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And show to the world that hope is not dead!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be patient! Wait! See what yet may befall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the hell and the hard of it all.<br /></span>
<span class="i8"><i>Ethyl Lewis.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>But in dark days the Negro has ever had refuges and sources of strength
for the want of which other races have been crushed. One of these
refuges for them is the benignant breast of nature&mdash;the deep peace of
the woods and the hills, the quiet soothing of pleasant-running water,
the benediction of bright skies. A rarely-gifted woman, Mrs. Georgia
Douglas Johnson, singing her own consolation, with a pathos that pierces
the heart, has sung for thousands of the women of her race else dumb
alike in grief and in joy, and in mingled grief and joy:</p>

<p class="cpom">PEACE</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I rest me deep within the wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drawn by its silent call;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far from the throbbing crowd of men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On nature’s breast I fall.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My couch is sweet with blossoms fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bed of fragrant dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soft upon my ear there falls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lullaby of streams.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The tumult of my heart is stilled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within this sheltered spot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in the bosom of the wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgetting, and&mdash;forgot!<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_62" id="page_62">{62}</a></span></div></div>
</div>

<p>Death and the mysteries of life, the pain and the grief that flesh and
soul are heirs to, the eternal problems that address themselves to all
generations and races, produce in the soul of the Negro the same
reactions as of old they produced in the soul of David or of Homer, or
as, in our own day, in the soul of a Wordsworth or a Shelley. Of this we
have a glimpse in the following lyric, from Walter Everette Hawkins:</p>

<p class="cpom">IN SPITE OF DEATH</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Curses come in every sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wars spread gloom and woe around.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cannon belch forth death and doom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still the lilies wave and bloom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man fills the earth with grief and wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But cannot hush the bluebird’s song.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My stars are dancing on the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waves fling kisses up at me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each night my gladsome moon doth rise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rainbow spans my evening skies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The robin’s song is full and fine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And roses lift their lips to mine.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The jonquils ope their petals sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The poppies dance around my feet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In spite of winter and of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Spring is in the zephyr’s breath.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>This poetry but re-affirms the essential identity of human nature under
black and white skins. But it will remind most of the white race of how
ignorant they have been of that black race next<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_63" id="page_63">{63}</a></span> door that is acquiring
wealth and culture and is expressing in art and literature the spirit of
an aspiring people&mdash;how ignorant of their real life, their very
thoughts, their completely human joys and griefs. One of their poets was
cognizant of this unhappy ignorance&mdash;the source of so much harshness of
treatment&mdash;when he wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My people laugh and sing<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And dance to death&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None imagining<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The heartbreak under breath.<br /></span>
<span class="i8"><i>Charles Bertram Johnson.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Nothing weighs more heavily upon the soul of this race to-day than this
everywhere self-betraying crass ignorance, made the more grievous to
endure by the vain boast accompanying it, that “I know the Negro better
than he knows himself.” This poetry in every line of it is a convincing
contradiction of this insulting arrogancy. Essential identity, that is
the message of these poets.</p>

<p>This kinship of souls and essential oneness of human nature, which
Shylock, speaking for a similarly oppressed and outrageously treated
people, pressed home upon the Christian merchants of Venice, finds
typical expression in the following lines:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We travel a common road, Brother,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We walk and we talk much the same;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We breathe the same sweet air of heaven&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strive alike for fortune and fame;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_64" id="page_64">{64}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">We laugh when our hearts fill with gladness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We weep when we’re smothered in woe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We strive, we endure, we seek wisdom;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We sin&mdash;and we reap what we sow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, all who would know it can see that<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When everything’s put to the test,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In spite of our color and features,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Negro’s the same as the rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i8"><i>Leon R. Harris.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>It is to be expected that, notwithstanding the Anglo-Saxon culture of
the producers of this poetry, the white reader will yet demand therein
what he regards as the African traits. Perhaps it will be crude,
artless, repetitious songs like the Spirituals. The quality of the
Spirituals is indeed not wanting in some of the most noteworthy
contemporary Negro verse. From Fenton Johnson’s three volumes of verse I
could select many pieces that exhibit this quality united with
disciplined art. For example, here is one:</p>

<p class="cpom">I PLAYED ON DAVID’S HARP</p>

<p class="cpom">(A Negro Spiritual)</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Last night I played on David’s harp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I played on little David’s harp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gospel tunes of Israel;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the angels came to hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Me play those gospel tunes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the Jordan rolled away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_65" id="page_65">{65}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The angels shouted all the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their “Glory, Hallelujah” shout;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Gabriel threw his trumpet down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hear the songs of Israel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On mighty David’s harp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the Jordan rolled away.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When death has closed my weary eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’ll play again on David’s harp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last great song in life’s brief book;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all you children born of God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can stop awhile and hear me play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the Jordan rolls away.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>No less certain it is that many a reader will demand something more
crude, more obscure, more mystical. Something, perhaps, at once
ridiculous and wise&mdash;with big and strangely compounded words,
ludicrously applied, yet striving at the expression of some peculiarly
African idea. Of such verse I can produce no example. The nearest I can
come to meeting such impossible demand is by submitting the following
from William Edgar Bailey:</p>

<p class="cpom">THE SLUMP</p>

<p>Of humorous verse there is very little produced by the Negro writers of
these times. They take their vocation seriously. When their singing
robes are on it is to the plaintive notes of the flute or the dolorous
blasts of the trumpet they tune their songs.</p>

<p>These voices, and others like them, have but lately been lifted in song,
they are still youthful voices, and they are but preluding the more
perfect songs they are yet to sing. One voice that is now still,
silenced lately in death, at the age of twenty-three years, has sung for
them all what all feel:</p>

<p class="cpom">THE MULATTO TO HIS CRITICS</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ashamed of my race?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of what race am I?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am many in one.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through my veins there flows the blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Red Man, Black Man, Briton, Celt, and Scot,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And puts sweet music into my soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i8"><i>Joseph S. Cotter, Jr.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>“Sweet music in the soul”&mdash;that is heaven’s kind gift to this people,
music of sorrow and of faith; music, low and plaintive, of hope almost
failing; music, clear and strong, born of vision triumphant; music,
alas, sometimes marred by the strident notes of hatred and revenge.
Verily, poets learn in suffering what they teach in song.</p>

<p>In concluding this preliminary survey it should be reiterated that, if
one meets here but with the rhythms and forms, as he may think, which
are familiar to him in the poetry of the white race, he should reflect
that only in that poetry has the Negro had an opportunity to be
educated. He has been educated away from his own heritage and his own
endowments. The Negro’s native wisdom should lead him back to his
natural founts of song. Our educational system should allow of and
provide for this. His own literature in his schools is a reasonable
policy for the Negro.</p>

<p>As regards the essential significance of this poetry, one of its makers,
Miss Eva A. Jessye, has said in a beautiful way almost what I wish to
say. Her poem shall therefore conclude this presentation:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_69" id="page_69">{69}</a></span></p>

<p>On the Kentucky plantation where Stephen Collins Foster one June
morning, when the mocking birds were singing and “the darkies were gay,”
composed and his sister sang, “My Old Kentucky Home,” there was among
those first delighted listeners who paused in their tasks to hear the
immortal song at its birth a slave girl in whose soul were strange
melodies of her own. Born of free people of color, she was bonded to the
owner of this plantation, yet her soul was such as must be free.
Faithful in her work, respectful and obedient, she was yet a dangerous
character among slaves, being too spirited. Hence her master ordered her
to leave, fearing she would demoralize discipline in the quarters. She
de<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_71" id="page_71">{71}</a></span>manded to be taken away as she had been brought&mdash;in a wagon; and it
was so done. It seems that one-half of her blood was African and the
other half was divided between Indian and English, though it is
impossible to be sure of the exact proportion. An account of her in
those days by one who knew her reveals her as one of nature’s poets&mdash;a
Phillis Wheatley of the wash-tubs. “She was very fervent in her
religious devotions”&mdash;so runs this account&mdash;“and a very hard worker. She
would sometimes wash nearly all night and then have periods of prayer
and exaltation. Then again during the day she would draw from her bosom
a favorite book and pause to read over the wash-tub. She had a strong
dramatic instinct and would frequently make up little plays of her own
and represent each character vividly.” Of such mothers are seers and
poets born. And so in this instance it proved to be.</p>

<p>At the age of twenty, while yet a slave, she was married, under the
common law&mdash;though marriage it was not called&mdash;to a Scotch-Irishman, a
prominent citizen of Louisville, her employer at the time, who was
distinguished by a notably handsome physique and a great fondness for
books. Of this union was born, at Bardstown, a son, Joseph, so named for
the dreamer of biblical story.</p>

<p>The vision-seeing slave mother, her mind running on the bondage of her
people, named her son Joseph in the hope of his becoming great in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_72" id="page_72">{72}</a></span>
service of his people, like the Hebrew Joseph. She lived to see her hope
fulfilled. The boy’s earliest education was in song and story invented
and sung or told by his mother. He got a few terms of school, reaching
the third grade. At ten years of age he went to work in a brickyard of
Louisville to help support his mother. Even there the faculty that
afterwards distinguished him appears in action, to his relief in time of
trouble. Bigger boys, white and black, working in the same yard, hazed
and harried him. Fighting to victory was out of the question, against
such odds. Brains won where brawn was wanting. He observed that the men
at their noon rest-hour, the time of his distress, told stories and
laughed. He couldn’t join them, but he tried story-telling in the boy
group. It worked. The men, hearing the laughter, came over and joined
them. The persecuted boy became the entertainer of both groups. He had
won mastery by wit, the proudest mastery in the world.</p>

<p>Then, until he was twenty-two years of age, he was a teamster on the
levee. At this time the desire for an education mastered him and he
entered a night school&mdash;the primary grade. Hard toil and the struggle to
get on had not killed his soul but had wiped out his acquisitions of
book-knowledge. In two terms he was qualified to teach. He is now the
principal of the Samuel Coleridge-Taylor High School in Louisville, the
author of several books, a maker of songs and teller of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_73" id="page_73">{73}</a></span> stories, and a
man upright in conduct and wise in counsel.</p>

<p>It was at Bardstown, February 2, 1861, that Joseph Seamon Cotter was
born. Let Bardstown be put on the literary map of America, not because
Stephen Collins Foster wrote “My Old Kentucky Home” there, but because
one was born there the latchet of whose poetic shoes he was not worthy
to unloose. “A poet, a bard, to be born in Bardstown&mdash;how odd, and how
appropriate!” one exclaims. And <i>bard</i> seems exactly the right
appellation for this song-maker and story-man. But it is not altogether
so. In character bardlike, but not in appearance. Bards have long,
unkempt, white hair, which mingles with beards that rest on their
bosoms. Cotter’s square-cut chin is clean-shaven, and his large
brain-dome shows like a harvest moon. But he makes poems and invents and
discovers stories, and, bard-like, recites or relates them to whatever
audience may call for them&mdash;in schools, in churches, at firesides. Minus
the hairy habiliments he is a bard.</p>

<p>Some of Cotter’s stories come out of Africa and are “different,” as the
word goes. Some are “current among the colored folks of Louisville.”
These, too, are different. Some are tragedies and some are comedies and
some are tragi-comedies of everyday life among the Negroes. I will give
one entire tale here, selecting this particular one because of its
brevity, not its pre-eminence:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_74" id="page_74">{74}</a></span></p>

<p class="cpom">THE BOY AND THE IDEAL</p>
<div class="smblk">
<p>Once upon a time a Mule, a Hog, a Snake, and a Boy met. Said the Mule:
“I eat and labor that I may grow strong in the heels. It is fine to have
heels so gifted. My heels make people cultivate distance.”</p>

<p>Said the Hog: “I eat and labor that I may grow strong in the snout. It
is fine to have a fine snout. I keep people watching for my snout.”</p>

<p>“No exchanging heels for snouts,” broke in the Mule.</p>

<p>“No,” answered the Hog; “snouts are naturally above heels.”</p>

<p>Said the Snake: “I eat to live, and live to cultivate my sting. The way
people shun me shows my greatness. Beget stings, comrades, and stings
will beget glory.”</p>

<p>Said the Boy: “There is a star in my life like unto a star in the sky. I
eat and labor that I may think aright and feel aright. These rounds will
conduct me to my star. Oh, inviting star!”</p>

<p>“I am not so certain of that,” said the Mule. “I have noticed your kind
and ever see some of myself in them. Your star is in the distance.”</p>

<p>The Boy answered by smelling a flower and listening to the song of a
bird. The Mule looked at him and said: “He is all tenderness and care.
The true and the beautiful have robbed me of a kinsman. His star is
near.”</p>

<p>Said the Boy: “I approach my star.”</p>

<p>“I am not so certain of that,” interrupted the Hog. “I have noticed your
kind and I ever see some of myself in them. Your star is a delusion.”</p>

<p>The Boy answered by painting the flower and setting the notes of the
bird’s song to music.</p>

<p>The Hog looked at the boy and said: “His soul is attuned by nature. The
meddler in him is slain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_75" id="page_75">{75}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“I can all but touch my star,” cried the Boy.</p>

<p>“I am not so certain of that,” remarked the Snake. “I have watched your
kind and ever see some of myself in them. Stings are nearer than stars.”</p>

<p>The Boy answered by meditating upon the picture and music. The Snake
departed, saying that stings and stars cannot keep company.</p>

<p>The Boy journeyed on, ever led by the star. Some distance away the Mule
was bemoaning the presence of his heels and trying to rid himself of
them by kicking a tree. The Hog was dividing his time between looking
into a brook and rubbing his snout on a rock to shorten it. The Snake
lay dead of its own bite. The Boy journeyed on, led by an ever inviting
star.</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;Uncle Remus, in reality&mdash;and not exactly so. No copy. Not every
like is the same. An Uncle Remus with culture and conscious art, yet
unspoilt, the native qualities strong. And how poetic those qualities
are!</p>

<p>Well might one expect a teacher, if he writes verse, to write didactic
verse. But I think you will pronounce him to be an extraordinary teacher
and verse-writer who writes as Mr. Cotter does, for example, in:</p>

<p class="cpom">THE THRESHING FLOOR</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thrice blessed he who wields the flail<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Upon this century’s threshing floor;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A few slight strokes by him avail<br /></span>
<span class="i2">More than a hundred would of yore.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_76" id="page_76">{76}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Around him lies the ripened grain<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From every land and every age;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The weakest thresher should attain<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Unto the wisdom of the sage.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ambitious youth, this is the wealth<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The ages have bequeathed to thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou canst not take thy share by stealth<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor by mere ingenuity.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thy better self must spur thee on<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To win what time has made thy own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No hand but labor’s yet has drawn<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The sweets that labor’s hand has sown.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In verse presuming to be lyrical we hearken for the lyrical cry. That
cry is in his lines, melodiously uttered, and poignant. For example:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The flowers take the tears<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of the weeping night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And give them to the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For the day’s delight.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My passion takes the joys<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of the laughing day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And melts them into tears<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For my heart’s decay.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The sweet sadness of those stanzas lingers with one. A stanza from a
poem entitled “The Nation’s Neglected Child” may help us to their
secret:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_77" id="page_77">{77}</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I am not thy pampered steed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I am not thy welcome dog;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am of a lower breed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Even than thy Berkshire hog;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am thy neglected child&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Make me grow, but keep me wild.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In many of Cotter’s verses there is a sonorous flow which is evidence of
poetic power made creative by passion. Didacticism and philosophy do not
destroy the lyrical quality. In <i>The Book’s Creed</i> this teacher-poet
makes an appeal to his generation to be as much alive and as creative as
the creed makers of other days were. The slaves of the letter, the
mummers of mere formulas, he thus addresses:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You are dead to all the Then,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You are dead to all the Now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you hold that former men<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wore the garland for your brow.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Time and tide were theirs to brave,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Time and tide are yours to stem.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bow not o’er their open grave<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till you drop your diadem.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Honor all who strove and wrought,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Even to their tears and groans;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But slay not your honest thought<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through your reverence for their bones.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Cotter is a wizard at rhyming. His “Sequel to the Pied Piper of Hamelin”
surpasses the original<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_78" id="page_78">{78}</a></span>&mdash;Browning’s&mdash;in technique&mdash;that is, in rushing
rhythms and ingenious rhymes. It is an incredible success, with no hint
of a tour-de-force performance. Its content, too, is worthy of the
metrical achievement. I will lay the proof before the competent reader
in an extract or two from this remarkable accomplishment:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The last sweet notes the piper blew<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Were heard by the people far and wide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one by one and two by two<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They flocked to the mountain-side.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Some came, of course, intensely sad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some came looking fiercely mad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some came singing solemn hymns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some came showing shapely limbs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some came bearing the tops of yews,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some came wearing wooden shoes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some came saying what they would do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some came praying (and loudly too),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all for what? Can you not infer?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A-searching and lurching for the Pied Piper,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the boys and girls he had taken away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all were ready now to pay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Any amount that he should say.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">So begins the <i>Sequel</i>. Another passage, near the end, will indicate the
trend of the story:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The years passed by, as years will do,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When trouble is the master,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And always strives to bring to view<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A new and worse disaster;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_79" id="page_79">{79}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sorrow, like a sorcerer,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Spread out her melancholy pall,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So that its folds enveloped all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each became her worshipper.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not a single child was born<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through all the years thereafter;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If words sprang from the lips of scorn<br /></span>
<span class="i2">None came from those of laughter.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">Finally, the inhabitants of Hamelin are passing through death’s portal,
and when all had departed:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;a message went to Rat-land<br /></span>
<span class="ispc1">******<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lo! a race of rats was at hand<br /></span>
<span class="ispc1">******<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They swarmed into the highest towers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And loitered in the fairest bowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sat down where the mayor sat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And also in his Sunday hat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gnawed revengefully thereat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rats for mayor and rats for people,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rats in the cellar and rats in the steeple,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rats without and rats within,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood poor, deserted Hamelin.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Like Dunbar, Cotter is a satirist of his people&mdash;or certain types of his
people&mdash;a gentle, humorous, affectionate satirist. His medium for satire
is dialect, inevitably. Sententious wisdom, irradiated with humor,
appears in these pieces in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_80" id="page_80">{80}</a></span> homely garb. In standard English, without
satire or humor that wisdom thus appears:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What deeds have sprung from plow and pick!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What bank-rolls from tomatoes!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No dainty crop of rhetoric<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Can match one of potatoes.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The gospel of work has been set forth by our poet in a four-act poetic
drama entitled <i>Caleb, the Degenerate</i>. All the characters are Negroes.
The form is blank verse&mdash;blank verse of a very high order, too. The
language, like Shakespeare’s&mdash;though Browning rather than Shakespeare is
suggested&mdash;is always that of a poet. The wisdom is that of a man who has
observed closely and pondered deeply. Idealistic, philosophical,
poetical&mdash;such it is. It bears witness to no ordinary dramatic ability.</p>

<p>“Best bard, because the wisest,” says our Israfel. Verily. “Sage” you
may call this man as well as “bard.” The proof is in poems and tales,
apologues and apothegms. Joseph Seamon Cotter is now sixty years of age.
Yet the best of him, according to good omens, is yet to be given forth,
in song, story, precept, and drama. His nature is opulent&mdash;the
cultivation began late and the harvest grows richer.</p>

<p>The chief event of his life, I doubt not, remains to be mentioned&mdash;a
very sad one. This was the untimely death of his poet-son, Joseph S.
Cotter, Jr. Born of this sorrow was the following lyric:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_81" id="page_81">{81}</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, my way and thy way,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And life’s joy and wonder,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thy day and my day<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Are cloven asunder.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, my trust and thy trust,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And fair April weather,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thy dust and my dust<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shall mingle together.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<h4><i>The Son</i></h4>

<p>Dead at the age of twenty-three years, Joseph S. Cotter, Jr., left
behind a thin volume of lyrics, entitled <i>The Band of Gideon</i>, and about
twenty sonnets of an unfinished sequence, and a little book of one-act
plays. I will presently place the remarkable title-poem of his book of
lyrics before the reader, but first I will give two minor pieces,

<p>The lyrical faculty is evinced by such poems. But other singers of our
day might have produced them&mdash;singers of the white race. Not so, I
think, of “The Band of Gideon.” Upon that poem is the stamp, not of
genius only, but of Negro genius. In it is re-incarnated, by a cultured,
creative mind, the very spirit of the old plantation songs and sermons.
The reader who has in his possession that background will respond to the
unique and powerful appeal of this poem.</p>

<span class="i0">And strike their tongues of blasphemy dumb.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Each black cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Is a fiery steed.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And they cry aloud<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With each strong deed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“The Sword of the Lord and Gideon.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The reader, I predict, will be drawn again and again to this mysterious
poem. It will continue to haunt his imagination, and tease his thought.
The stamp of the African mind is upon it. Closely<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_85" id="page_85">{85}</a></span> allied, on the one
hand by its august refrain to the Spirituals, on the other hand it
touches the most refined and perfected art; such, for example, as
Rossetti’s ballads or Vachel Lindsay’s cantatas. It can scarcely be
wondered at that the people of his race should call this untimely dead
singer their Negro Lycidas.</p>

<p>Cherokee-Indian, Scotch-Irish, French, and African blood in James David
Corrothers, the author of this poem, makes his complexion, he supposed,
“about that of the original man.” The reader has already had, at the
beginning of the discussion of Dunbar, a sonnet from this poet. The
sonnet, the above poem, and the others given here were published in <i>The
Century Magazine</i>. Not unworthy of <i>The Century’s</i> standards, the reader
must say.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">J. D. Corrothers</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>James David Corrothers was born in Michigan, July 2, 1869. His mother in
giving him life sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_87" id="page_87">{87}</a></span>rendered her own. His father never cared for him.
Sheltered for a few years by maternal relatives, he was out on the world
in early boyhood, dependent on his own resources. Soon, because he was a
Negro, he was a wanderer for work through several states. Often without
money, friends, or food, he slept out of doors, sometimes in zero
weather. At nineteen years of age, as before stated, he was shining
shoes in a Chicago barber shop. There he was “discovered.”</p>

<p>Henry D. Lloyd was having his boots shined by young Corrothers when the
two fell into book talk. The distinguished writer was astonished at the
knowledge possessed by one engaged in such a menial occupation. Out of
this circumstance, it seems, the Negro boot-black became a student in
Northwestern University at Evanston, Illinois. By mowing lawns and doing
whatever odd jobs he could find he worked his way for three years in the
university. Then, by the kindness of Frances E. Willard, he had a year
in Bennett College, Greensboro, North Carolina. Prior to his entrance at
Northwestern there had been but one brief opportunity in his life for
attending school. But the wandering youth, battling against the adverse
fates, or, concretely stated, the disadvantage of being a Negro, had
managed somehow to make great books his companions. Hence, he had
entered what Carlyle calls “the true modern university.” Hence, his
literary conversation with Mr. Lloyd.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_88" id="page_88">{88}</a></span></p>

<p>Out of those early struggles, and perhaps also out of later bitter
experiences, came such poems as the following:</p>

<p class="cpom">AT THE CLOSED GATE OF JUSTICE</p>

<div class="poetry">

<span class="i0">To be a Negro in a day like this<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Still must one succor those who brought one low,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">“Merely a Negro”&mdash;in a day like <i>this</i>!<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Even though his face be “red like Adam’s,” and even though his art be
noble like that of the masters of song, yet had Mr. Corrothers, even in
the republic of letters, felt the handicap of his complexion, as this
sonnet bears witness:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_89" id="page_89">{89}</a></span></p>

<h3>III. <span class="smcap">A Group of Singing Johnsons</span></h3>

<p>In all rosters the name Johnson claims liberal space. Five verse-smiths
with that cognomen will be presented in this book, and there is a sixth.
These many Johnsons are no further related to one another, so far as I
know, than that they are all Adam’s offspring, and poets. Only three of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_90" id="page_90">{90}</a></span>
them will be presented in this chapter: James Weldon Johnson, of
Florida, author of <i>Fifty Years and Other Poems</i> (1917); Charles Bertram
Johnson, of Missouri, author of <i>Songs of My People</i> (1918); Fenton
Johnson, of Chicago, author of <i>A Little Dreaming</i> (1914); <i>Unions of
the Dusk</i> (1915), and <i>Songs of the Soil</i> (1916). The fourth and fifth
are women, and will find a place in another group; the sixth is Adolphus
Johnson, author of <i>The Silver Chord</i>, Philadelphia, 1915. The three
mentioned above will be treated in the order in which they have been
named.</p>

<h4><i>1. James Weldon Johnson</i></h4>

<p>Now of New York, but born in Florida and reared in the South, James
Weldon Johnson is a man of various abilities, accomplishments, and
activities. He was graduated with the degrees of A. B. and A. M. from
Atlanta University and later studied for three years in Columbia
University. First a school-principal, then a practitioner of the law, he
followed at last the strongest propensity and turned author. His
literary work includes light operas, for which his brother, J. Rosamond
Johnson, composed the music, and a novel entitled <i>The Autobiography of
an Ex-Colored Man</i>. Having been United States consul in two
Latin-American countries, he is a master of Spanish and has made
translations of Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_91" id="page_91">{91}</a></span> plays and poems. The English libretto of
<i>Goyescas</i> was made by him for the Metropolitan Opera Company in 1915.
He is also one of the ablest editorial writers in the country. In the
<i>Public Ledger’s</i> contest of 1916 he won the third prize. His editorials
are widely syndicated in the Negro weekly press. Poems of his have
appeared in <i>The Century</i>, <i>The Crisis</i>, and <i>The Independent</i>.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">James Weldon Johnson</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Professor Brander Matthews in his Introduction to <i>Fifty Years and Other
Poems</i> speaks of “the superb and soaring stanzas” of the title-poem and
describes it as “a poem sonorous in its diction, vigorous in its
workmanship, elevated in its imagination, and sincere in its emotion.”
Doubtless this will seem like the language of exaggeration. The sceptic,
however, must withhold judgment until he has read the poem, too long for
presentation here. Mr. Johnson’s poetical qualities can be represented
in this place only by briefer though inferior productions. A poem of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_92" id="page_92">{92}</a></span>
special significance, and characterized by the qualities noted by
Professor Matthews in “Fifty Years,” is the following:</p>

<p class="cpom">O SOUTHLAND!</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O Southland! O Southland!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Have you not heard the call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trumpet blown, the word made known<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The watchword, the hope-word,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And know you not their way?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis forward, ’tis upward,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On to the fair white arch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Freedom’s dome, and there is room<br /></span>

<span class="i0">’Tis springtime! ’Tis work-time!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The world is young again!<br /></span>

<span class="i2">That weakness stalks in pride;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he is strong who helps along<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The faint one at his side.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>For pure lyric beauty and exquisite pathos, Wordsworthian in both
respects, but no hint of imitation, the following stanzas may be set,
without disadvantage to them, by the side of any in our literature:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The glory of the day was in her face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beauty of the night was in her eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over all her loveliness, the grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Morning blushing in the early skies.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And in her voice, the calling of the dove;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like music of a sweet, melodious part.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in her smile, the breaking light of love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the gentle virtues in her heart.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now the glorious day, the beauteous night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The birds that signal to their mates at dawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To my dull ears, to my tear-blinded sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are one with all the dead, since she is gone.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Yet one other poem of this fine singer’s I will give, selecting from not
a few that press for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_94" id="page_94">{94}</a></span> restricted space. The easy flow of the verse
and the ready rhyme will be remarked&mdash;and that supreme quality of good
lyric poetry, austere simplicity.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_95" id="page_95">{95}</a></span></div></div>
</div>

<p>Arduous labors in other fields than poetry threaten to silence Mr.
Johnson’s muse, and that is to be regretted.</p>

<h4>2. <i>Charles Bertram Johnson</i></h4>

<p>School-teacher, preacher, poet&mdash;this is Charles Bertram Johnson of
Missouri. And in Missouri there is no voice more tuneful, no artistry in
song any finer, than his. Nor in so bold an assertion am I forgetting
the sweet voice and exquisite artistry of Sarah Teasdale. Mr. Johnson’s
art is not unlike hers in all that makes hers most charming. Only there
is not so much of his that attains to perfection of form. On pages 52
and 63 were given two of his quatrain poems. These were of his people.
But a lyric poet should sing himself. That is of the essence of lyric
poetry. In so singing, however, the poet reveals not only his individual
life, but that of his race to the view of the world. Another quatrain
poem, personal in form, may be accepted as of racial interpretation:</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 197px;"><a name="ill_014" id="ill_014"></a>
<a href="images/i_095_lg.jpg">
<img src="images/i_095_sml.jpg" width="197" height="259" alt="[Image unavailable.]" /></a>
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Charles Bertram Johnson</span></p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_96" id="page_96">{96}</a></span></p>

<p class="cpom">SOUL AND STAR</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So oft from out the verge afar<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The dear dreams throng and throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes I think my soul a star,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And life a pulséd song.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Born at Callao, Missouri, October 5, 1880, of a Kentucky mother and a
Virginia father, Charles Bertram Johnson attended a one-room school
“across the railroad track,” where&mdash;who can explain this?&mdash;he was
“Introduced to Bacon, Shakespeare, and the art of rhyming.” It reads
like an old story. Some freak of a schoolmaster whose head is filled
with “useless” lore&mdash;poetry, tales, and “such stuff”&mdash;nurturing a child
of genius into song. But it was Johnson’s mother who was the great
influence in his life. She was an “adept at rhyming” and “she initiated
me into the world of color and melody”&mdash;so writes our poet. It is always
the mother. Then, by chance&mdash;but how marvelously chance comes to the aid
of the predestined!&mdash;by chance, he learns of Dunbar and his poetry. The
ambition to be a poet of his people like Dunbar possesses him. He knows
the path to that goal is education. He therefore makes his way to a
little college at Macon, Missouri, from which, after five years, he is
graduated&mdash;without having received any help in the art of poetry,
however. Two terms at a summer school and special instruction by
correspondence seem to have aided<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_97" id="page_97">{97}</a></span> him here, or to have induced the
belief that he had been aided. For twenty-odd years he followed the
profession of teaching. For ten years of that period he also preached.
The ministry now claims his entire energies, and the muse knocks less
and less frequently at his door.</p>

<p>Yet he still sings. In a recent number of <i>The Crisis</i> I find a poem of
his that in suggesting a life of toil growing to a peaceful close is
filled with soothing melody:</p>

<p class="cpom">OLD FRIENDS</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sit here before my grate,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Until it’s ashen gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or till the night grows late,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And talk the time away.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I cannot think to sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And miss your golden speech,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My bed of dreams will keep&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You here within my reach.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I have so much to say,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The time is short at best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bit of toil and play,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And after that comes rest.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But you and I know now<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The wisdom of the soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The years that seamed the brow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Have made our visions whole.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_98" id="page_98">{98}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sit here before my grate<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Until the ash is cold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The things you say of late<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Are fine as shriven gold.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Even though one be born to sing, if circumstances have made him a
preacher he may be expected to moralize his song. Whether we shall be
reconciled to this will depend on the art with which it is done. If the
moral idea be a sweet human one, and if the verse still be melifluous,
we will submit, and our delight will be twofold&mdash;ethical and esthetical.
We will put our preacher-poet of Missouri to the test:</p>

<p class="cpom">SO MUCH</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So much of love I need,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And tender passioned care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of human fault and greed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To make me unaware:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So much of love I owe,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That, ere my life be done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How shall I keep His will<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To owe not any one?<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Truth is, Mr. Johnson is not given to preaching in verse any more than
other poets. His sole aim is beauty. He assures me it is truth. Instead
of admitting disagreement I only assert that, being a poet, he must find
all truth beautiful. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_99" id="page_99">{99}</a></span> is only for relative thinking we need the three
terms, truth, goodness, and beauty.</p>

<p>I will conclude this presentation of the Missouri singer with a lyrical
sermonette:</p>

<p>A RAIN SONG</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Chill the rain falls, chill!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dull gray the world; the vale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rain-swept; wind-swept the hill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“But gloom and doubt prevail,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My heart breaks forth to say.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ere thus its sorrow-note,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Cheer up! Cheer up, to-day!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-morrow is to be!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Babbled from a joyous throat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A robin’s in a mist-gray tree.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then off to keep a tryst&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He preened his drabbled cloak&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doughty little optimist!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if in answer, broke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sunlight through that oak.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h4><i>3. Fenton Johnson</i></h4>

<p>Dreams and visions&mdash;such are the treasures of suffering loyal hearts:
dreams, visions, and song. Happy even in their sorrows the people to
whom God has given poets to be their spokesmen to the world. Else their
hearts should stifle with woe. As the prophet was of old so in these
times the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_100" id="page_100">{100}</a></span> poet. As a prophet speaks Fenton Johnson, his heart yearning
toward the black folk of our land:</p>

<p class="cpom">THESE ARE MY PEOPLE</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">These are my people, I have built for them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A castle in the cloister of my heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I shall fight that they may dwell therein.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The God that gave Sojourner tongue of fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has made with me a righteous covenant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That these, my brothers of the dusk, shall rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Sinai and thence in purple walk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A newer Canaan, vineyards of the West.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rods that chasten us shall break as straw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fire consume the godless in the South;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hand that struck the helpless of my race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall wither as a leaf in drear November,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And liberty, the nectar God has blest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall flow as free as wine in Babylon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O God of Covenants, forget us not!<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Fenton Johnson seems to be more deeply rooted in the song-traditions of
his people than are most of his fellow-poets. To him the classic
Spirituals afford inspiration and pattern. Whoever is familiar with
those “canticles of love and woe” will recognize their influence
throughout Mr. Johnson’s three volumes of song. I shall make no attempt
here to illustrate this truth but shall rather select a piece or two
that will represent the poet’s general qualities. Other poems more
typical of him as a melodist could be found but these have special
traits that commend them for this place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_101" id="page_101">{101}</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Vision of Lazarus</i>, contained in <i>A Little Dreaming</i>, is a
blank-verse poem of about three-hundred lines, original, well-sustained,
imaginative, and deeply impressive.</p>

<p>In one of the newer methods of verse, and yet with a splendid suggestion
of the old Spirituals, I will take from a recent magazine a poem by Mr.
Johnson that will show how the vision of his people is turned toward the

<h4>4. <i>Adolphus Johnson</i></h4>

<p>From the <i>Preface</i> of Adolphus Johnson’s <i>The Silver Chord</i> I will take
a paragraph that is more poetic and perfect in expression than any
stanza in his book. Poetry, I think, is in him, but when he wrote these
rhymes he was not yet sufficiently disciplined in expression. But this
is how he can say a thing in prose:</p>

<p>“As the Goddess of Music takes down her lute, touches its silver chords,
and sets the summer melodies of nature to words, so an inspiration<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_105" id="page_105">{105}</a></span>
comes to me in my profoundest slumbers and gently awakens my highest
faculties to the finest thought and serenest contemplation herein
expressed. Always remember that a book is your best friend when it
compels you to think, disenthralls your reason, enkindles your hopes,
vivifies your imagination, and makes easier all the burdens of your
daily life.”</p>

<h4><i>IV. William Stanley Braithwaite</i></h4>

<p>The critical and the creative faculties rarely dwell together in
harmony. One or the other finally predominates. In the case of Mr.
Braithwaite it seems to be the critical faculty. He has preferred, it
seems, to be America’s chief anthologist, encouraging others up rugged
Parnassus, rather than himself to stand on the heights of song. Since
1913 he has edited a series of annual anthologies of American magazine
verse, which he has provided with critical reviews of the verse output
of the respective year. Of several anthologies of English verse also he
is the editor. Three books of original verse stand to his credit:
<i>Lyrics of Life and Love</i> (1904), <i>The House of Falling Leaves</i> (1908),
and <i>Sandy Star and Willie Gee</i> (1922). These dates seem to prove that
the creative impulse has waned.</p>

<p>Verse artistry, in simple forms, reaches a degree of excellence in Mr.
Braithwaite’s lyrics that has rarely been surpassed in our times.
Graceful and esthetically satisfying expression is given to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_106" id="page_106">{106}</a></span> elusive or
mystical and rare fancies. I will give one of his brief lyrics as an
example of the qualities to which I allude:</p>

<p class="cpom">SANDY STAR</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No more from out the sunset,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No more across the foam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more across the windy hills<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Will Sandy Star come home.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He went away to search it,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With a curse upon his tongue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in his hands the staff of life<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Made music as it swung.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I wonder if he found it,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And knows the mystery now:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our Sandy Star who went away<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With the secret on his brow.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In a number of Mr. Braithwaite’s lyrics, as in this one, there is an
atmosphere of mystery that, with the charming simplicity of manner,
strongly suggests Blake. There is a strangeness in all beauty, it has
been said. There is commonly something of Faëryland in the finest lyric
poetry. Another lyric illustrating this quality in Mr. Braithwaite is
the following:</p>

<p class="cpom">IT’S A LONG WAY</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It’s a long way the sea-winds blow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Over the sea-plains blue,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But longer far has my heart to go<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Before its dreams come true.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_107" id="page_107">{107}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It’s work we must, and love we must,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And do the best we may,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And take the hope of dreams in trust<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To keep us day by day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It’s a long way the sea-winds blow&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But somewhere lies a shore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus down the tide of Time shall flow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My dreams forevermore.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Braithwaite’s art rises above race. He seems not to be
race-conscious in his writing, whether prose or verse. Yet no man can
say but that race has given his poetry the distinctive quality I have
indicated. In this connection a most interesting poem is his “A New
England Spinster.” The detachment is perfect, the analysis is done in
the spirit of absolute art. I will quote but two of its dozen or so
stanzas:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She dwells alone, and never heeds<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How strange may sound her own footfall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet is prompt to others’ needs,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or ready at a neighbor’s call.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But still her world is one apart,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Serene above desire and change;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are no hills beyond her heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beyond her gate, no winds that range.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Here is the true artist’s imagination that penetrates to the secrets of
life. No poet’s lyrics, with their deceptive simplicity, better reward
study for a full appreciation of their idea. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_108" id="page_108">{108}</a></span> much of suggestion to
the reader of the poems which follow:</p>

<p class="cpom">FOSCATI</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Blest be Foscati! You’ve heard tell<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How&mdash;spirit and flesh of him&mdash;blown to flame,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And felt no shame.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I here indite this record of his journey:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The splendor of his epical will to perform<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Was a joy embraced.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_109" id="page_109">{109}</a></span></div></div>
</div>

<p class="cpom">THANKING GOD</p>

<div class="poetry">

<span class="i0">The way folks had of thanking God<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He found annoying, till he thought<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And so the habit grew, and then&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of when and how he did not care&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The mystic verb in a grammar of prayer.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He never knelt, nor uttered words&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And all my senses are thanking God.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Braithwaite is thoroughly conversant, as these selections indicate,
with the subtleties and finest effects of the art poetic, and his
impulses to write spring from the deepest human speculations, the purest
motives of art. Hence in his work he takes his place among the few.</p>

<h4><i>V. George Reginald Margetson</i></h4>

<p>Under tropical suns, amid the tropical luxuriance of nature, developed
the many-hued imagination of the subject of this sketch. His nature is
tropical, for Mr. Margetson is a prolific bard: <i>Songs of Life</i>, <i>The
Fledgling Bard and the Poetry Society</i>, <i>Ethiopia’s Flight</i>, <i>England in
the West Indies</i>&mdash;four published books, and more yet un<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_110" id="page_110">{110}</a></span>published&mdash;are
proof. No excerpts can fully reveal the distinctive quality of Mr.
Margetson’s poetry&mdash;its sonorous and ever-varying flow, like a mountain
stream, its descriptive richness in which it resembles his native
islands. For he was born in the British West Indies, and there lived the
first twenty years of his life. Coming to America in 1897, his home has
been in Boston or its environment since that time. Educated in the
Moravian School at St. Kitts, he has lived with and in the English poets
from Spenser to Byron&mdash;Byron seems to have been his favorite&mdash;and so has
cultivated his native talent. I can give here but one brief lyric from
his pen.</p>

<h4><i>VI. William Moore</i></h4>

<p>The productions I have seen in the Negro magazines and newspapers from
William Moore’s pen give me the idea of a poet distinctly original and
distinctly endowed with imagination. If there appears some obscurity in
his poems let it not be too hastily set down against him as a fault.
Some ideas are intrinsically obscure. The expression of them that should
be lucid would be false, inadequate. Some poets there needs must be who,
escaping from the inevitable, the commonplace, will transport us out
into infinity to confront the eternal mysteries. Mr. Moore does this in
two sonnets which I will give to represent his poetic work:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_112" id="page_112">{112}</a></span></p>

<p>Poets are born and nurtured in all conditions of life: Joseph Cotter the
elder was a slave-woman’s child; Dunbar wrote his first book between the
runs of the elevator he tended; Leon R. Harris was left in infancy to
the dreary shelter of an orphanage, then indentured to a brutal farmer;
Carmichael came from the cabin of an unlettered farmer in the Black Belt
of Alabama; of a dozen others the story is similar. Born in poverty, up
through adversities they struggled, with little human help save perhaps
from the croons and caresses of a singing mother, and a few terms at a
wretched school, they toiled into the kingdom of knowledge and entered
the world of poetry. Some, however, have had the advantages afforded by
parents of culture and of means. Among these is the subject of this
sketch, the son of Bishop J. H. Jones, of the African Methodist
Episcopal Church. He has had the best educa<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_114" id="page_114">{114}</a></span>tional opportunity offered
by American colleges. He is a graduate of Brown University. Writing has
been his employment since graduation, and he has been on the staffs of
several New England papers. His first book of poems, entitled <i>The Heart
of the World</i> (1919), now in the second edition, reveals at once a
student of poetry and an independent artist in verse. His second book,
<i>Poems of the Four Seas</i> (1921), shows that his vein is still rich in
ore.</p>

<p>In Chapter VIII I give his “Goodbye, Old Year.” Another poem of similar
technique takes for its title the last words of Colonel Roosevelt: “Turn
out the light, please.” The reader cannot but note the sense of proper
effect exhibited in the short sentences, the very manner of a dying man.
But more than this will be perceived in this poem. It will seem to have
sprung out of the world-weary soul of the young poet himself. Struggle,
grief, weariness in the strife, have been his also. Hence:</p>

<p class="cpom">TURN OUT THE LIGHT</p>

<p>The title-piece of Mr. Jones’s first volume reveals his mastery of
effective form and his command of the language of passionate appeal. The
World War, in which the Negroes of the country gave liberally and
heroically, both of blood and treasure, for democracy, quickened failing
hopes in them and kindled anew their aspirations. In this poem the
writer speaks for his entire race:</p>

<p>This is a faithful self-characterization&mdash;such a man in reality is
Walter Everette Hawkins. A fearless and independent and challenging
spirit. He is the rare kind of man that must put everything to the
severe test of absolute principles. He hates shams, hypocrisies,
compromises, chicaneries, injustices. His poems are the bold and
faithful expressions of his personality. Free he has ever been, free he
will be ever, striking right out for freedom and truth. Such a
personality is refreshing to meet, whether you encounter it in the flesh
or in a book.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_121" id="page_121">{121}</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Walter Everette Hawkins</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Born about thirty-five years ago, on a little farm in North Carolina,
the thirteenth child of ex-slave parents, young Hawkins, one may
imagine, was not opulent in this world’s goods. Nor were his
opportunities such as are usually considered thrilling. A few terms of
miserable schooling in the village of Warrenton, the fragments of a few
more terms in a school maintained by the African Methodist Church,
then&mdash;“the University of Hard Knocks.” In the two first-named schools
the independent-spirited lad seems not to have gotten along well with
his teachers, hence a few dismissals. Always too prone to ask
troublesome, challenging questions, too prone to doubts and reflections,
he was thought incorrigible. In his “University” he chose his own
masters&mdash;the great free spirits of the ages&mdash;and at the feet of these he
was teachable, even while the knocks were hardest.</p>

<p>A lover of wild nature and able to commune with nature’s spirit, deeply
fond also of commun<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_122" id="page_122">{122}</a></span>ing with the world’s master minds in books, Mr.
Hawkins is by necessity&mdash;while his spirit soars&mdash;the slave of routine
toil, being, until recently, a mail clerk in the post office of the City
of Washington. “My only recreation,” he writes me, “is in stealing away
to be with the masters, the intellectual dynamos, of the world, who
converse with me without wincing and deliver me the key to life’s
riddle.”</p>

<p>A true expression of himself I said Mr. Hawkins’s poems are. In no
degree are they fictions. As a companion to <i>Credo</i>, quoted to introduce
him, I will give the last poem in his book, which will again set him
before us as he is:</p>

<p class="cpom">HERO OF THE ROAD</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let me seek no statesman’s mantle,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Let me seek no victor’s wreath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let my sword unstained in battle<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Still lie rusting in its sheath;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let my garments be unsullied,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Let no man’s blood to me cling;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life is love and earth is heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If I may but soar and sing.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This then is my sternest struggle,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ease the load and sing my song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lift the lame and cheer the cheerless<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As they plod the road along;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we see ourselves transfigured<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In a new and bigger plan;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man transformed, his own Messiah,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">God embodied into man.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_123" id="page_123">{123}</a></span></div></div>
</div>

<p>For the whining craven class of men Mr. Hawkins has little respect:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The man who complains<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When the world is all song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or dares to sit mute<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When the world is all wrong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who barters his freedom<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Vile honors to win,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deserves but to die<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With the vilest of men.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Upon the times in which we live his judgment is severe. His
condemnation, however, bears witness to that earnestness of soul and
that idealism of spirit which will not let the world repose in its
wickedness. From a list of several poems attesting this I select the
following as perhaps the most complete in form:</p>

<p class="cpom">THE DEATH OF JUSTICE</p>

<div class="poetry">

<span class="i0">Wrong sways the sceptre and Justice must yield.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A number of Mr. Hawkins’s productions reveal possibilities of beauty and
effectiveness, which he had not the patience or the skill to realize.
One imagines that he has never been able to bring his spirit to a
submissive study of the minutiæ of metrical composition. A poet <i>in
esse</i>&mdash;or <i>in posse</i>&mdash;is all that nature ever makes. And even the most
free spirit must know well the traditions. Whether this iconoclast knows
the Cavalier traditions of English poetry may be left to conjecture, but
the following piece, illustrating Mr. Hawkins’s faults and virtues as a
singer, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_125" id="page_125">{125}</a></span> prove his kinship to the poetic tribe of which Lovelace
and Suckling were conspicuous members:</p>

<p>An English subject, being born and growing to manhood in Jamaica, Claude
McKay, a pure blood Negro, was first discovered as a poet by English
critics. In Jamaica, as early as 1911, when he was but twenty-two years
of age, his <i>Constab Ballads</i>, in Negro dialect, was published. Even in
so broken a tongue this book revealed a poet&mdash;on the constabulary force
of Jamaica. In 1920 his first book of poems in literary English, <i>Spring

Richards, of Cambridge, England.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_127" id="page_127">{127}</a></span> Meanwhile, shortly after the
publication of his first book, he had come to the United States.</p>

<p>Here he has worked at various occupations, has taken courses in
Agriculture and English in the Kansas State College, and has thus become
acquainted with life in the States. He is now on the editorial staff of
the <i>Liberator</i>, New York. There has been no poet of his race who has
more poignantly felt and more artistically expressed the life of the
American Negro. His poetry is a most noteworthy contribution to
literature. From <i>Spring in New Hampshire</i> I am privileged to take a
number of poems which will follow without comment:</p>

<p class="cpom">SPRING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Too green the springing April grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Too blue the silver-speckled sky,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When fields are fresh and streams are leaping,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His spirit in smoke ascended to high heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His Father, by the cruelest way of pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had bidden him to his bosom once again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The awful sin remained still unforgiven:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All night a bright and solitary star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Perchance the one that ever guided him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet gave him up at last to Fate’s wild whim)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hung pitifully o’er the swinging char.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Day dawned, and soon the mixed crowds came to view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ghastly body swaying in the sun:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The women thronged to look, but never a one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Showed sorrow in her eyes of steely blue,<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Applauding youths laughed with young prostitutes<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She sang and danced on gracefully and calm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The light gauze hanging loose about her form;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Grown lovelier for passing through a storm.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Profusely fell; and, tossing coins in praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wine-flushed, bold-eyed boys, and even the girls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Devoured her with eager, passionate gaze:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, looking at her falsely-smiling face,<br /></span>

<p class="cpom">IN BONDAGE</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I would be wandering in distant fields<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Her goodly gifts to all her children free;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where life is fairer, lighter, less demanding,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And boys and girls have time and space for play<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before they come to years of understanding,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Somewhere I would be singing, far away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For life is greater than the thousand wars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men wage for it in their insatiate lust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And will remain like the eternal stars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all that is to-day is ashes and dust:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I am bound with you in your mean graves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, black men, simple slaves of ruthless slaves.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Distinction of idea and phrase inheres in these poems. In them the Negro
is esthetically conceived, and interpreted with vision. This is art
working as it should. Mr. McKay has passion and the control of it to the
ends of art. He has the poet’s insight, the poet’s understanding.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most arresting poem in this list, and the one most surely
attesting the genius of the writer, is <i>The Harlem Dancer</i>. It is an
achievement in portrayal sufficient by itself to establish a poetic
reputation. The divination that penetrates to the secret purity of soul,
or nobleness of character, through denying appearances&mdash;how rare is the
faculty, and how necessary! Elsewhere I give a poem from a Negro woman
which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_130" id="page_130">{130}</a></span> evinces the same divine gift in the author, exhibited in a poem
no less original and no less deeply impressive&mdash;Mrs. Spencer’s <i>At the
Carnival</i>. Here I will companion <i>The Harlem Dancer</i> with one from Mr.
Dandridge, for the comparison will deepen the effect of each:</p>

<span class="i0">Her all was dancing&mdash;save her face.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A conscience, dumb to brooding fears,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And eyes obsessed with vacant stare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked over heads to empty air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As though they sought to find therein<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Redemption for a maiden sin.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">’Twas thus, amid force-driven grace,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That, though we saw&mdash;we saw not her.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Returning to Mr. McKay, we may assert that his new volume of verse,
<i>Harlem Shadows</i>, con<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_131" id="page_131">{131}</a></span>firms and enhances the estimate of him we have
expressed.</p>

<h4><i>X. Leslie Pinckney Hill</i></h4>

<div class="figright" style="width: 191px;"><a name="ill_019" id="ill_019"></a>
<a href="images/i_131_lg.jpg">
<img src="images/i_131_sml.jpg" width="191" height="260" alt="[Image unavailable.]" /></a>
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Leslie Pinckney Hill</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Bearing the diploma of the Lyric Muse, Mr. Leslie Pinckney Hill,
schoolmaster of Cheyney, Pennsylvania, and authentic singer, is one of
the newest arrivals on the slopes of Parnassus. A first glance tells
that he is an agile climber, sinewy, easy of movement, light of step,
with both grace and strength. Every indication in form and motion is for
some point far up toward the summit. Youthful he is, ambitious, plainly,
and, in spite of a burden, buoyant. “Climber,” I said. I will drop the
figure. Poets were never pedestrians. Mr. Hill comes not afoot. If not
on the wings of Pegasus, yet on wings he comes&mdash;<i>the wings of
oppression</i>. Sad wings! yet it must be remarked that it is commonly on
such wings that poets of whatever race and time rise. And Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_132" id="page_132">{132}</a></span> Hill’s
race knows no other wings. On the wings of oppression the Negro poet and
the Negro people are rising toward the summits of Parnassus, Pisgah, and
other peaks. This they know, too, and of it they are justly proud.</p>

<p>In his <i>Foreword</i> Mr. Hill thus states the case of his people, and, by
implication, of himself: “Nothing in the life of the nation has seemed
to me more significant than that dark civilization which the colored man
has built up in the midst of a white society organized against it. The
Negro has been driven under all the burdens of oppression, both material
and spiritual, to the brink of desperation, but he has always been saved
by his philosophy of life. He has advanced against all opposition by a
certain elevation of his spirit. He has been made strong in tribulation.
He has constrained oppression to give him wings.”</p>

<p>The significant thing about these wings, in a critical view, is that
they fulfill the proper function of wings&mdash;bear aloft and sustain in
flight through the azure depths. Mr. Hill’s wings do bear aloft and
sustain: if not always, nor even ever, into the very empyrean of poetry
yet invariably, seventy times, into the ampler air. Like all his race,
he has suffered much; and, like all his race still, he has gathered
wisdom from sorrow. As a true poet should have, he has philosophy, also
vision and imagination&mdash;vision for himself and his people, imagination
that sees facts in terms of beauty and presents truths with vital<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_133" id="page_133">{133}</a></span>
imagery. Add thereto craftsmanship acquired in the best traditions of
English poetry and you have Hill the poet.</p>

<p>The merit of his book cannot be shown by lines and stanzas. As ever with
true art, the merit lies in the whole effect of complete poems. Still,
we may here first detach from this and that poem a stanza or two,
despite the wrong to art. The first and fourth stanzas of the title-poem
will indicate Mr. Hill’s technique and philosophy:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I have a song that few will sing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In honor of all suffering,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A song to which my heart can bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The homage of believing&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A song the heavy-laden hears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the clamor of his fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While still he walks with blinding tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drains the cup of grieving.<br /></span>
<span class="ispc1">******<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So long as life is steeped in wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nations cry: “How long, how long!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I look not to the wise and strong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For peace and self-possession;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But right will rise, and mercy shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And justice lift her conquering sign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where lowly people starve and pine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath a world oppression.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The character and temper of the Negro in those gentler aspects which
make such an appeal to the heart are revealed in the following sonnet:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_134" id="page_134">{134}</a></span></p>

<p class="cpom">MATER DOLOROSA</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O mother, there are moments when I know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God’s presence to the full. The city street<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May wrap me in the tumult and the heat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of futile striving; bitter winds may blow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With winter-wilting freeze of hail and snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all my hopes lie shattered in defeat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in my heart the springtime blossoms sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heaven seems very near the way I go.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">These moments are the angels of that prayer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which thou hast breathed for many a troubled year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bended knee and swarthy-streaming face&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Uphold him, Father, with a double care:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is but mortal, yet his days must bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world cross, and the burden of his race.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>If these poems, taken collectively, do not declare “what is on the
Negro’s mind” they yet truly reveal, to the reflecting person, what has
sunk deep into his heart. They are therefore a message to America, a
protest, an appeal, and a warning. They will penetrate, I predict,
through breast-armor of <i>aes triplex</i> into the hearts of those whom
sermons and editorials fail to touch in the springs of action. Such is
the virtue of music wed to persuasive words. In strong lines of soaring
blank verse, in which Mr. Hill is particularly capable, he makes a
direct appeal to America in behalf of his people, in a poem entitled
Armageddon:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_135" id="page_135">{135}</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Because ye schooled them in the arts of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gave to them your God, and poured your blood<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They shall not fail you in the hour of need.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They own in them enough of you to feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that has made you masters in your time&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dear art and riches, unremitting toil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud types of beauty, an unbounded will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To triumph, wondrous science and old law&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These have they learned to covet and to share.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But deeper in them still is something steeled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hot abhorrence and unmeasured dread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of your undaunted sins against the light&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Red sins of lust, of envy and of hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of guilty gain extorted from the weak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of brotherhood traduced, and God denied.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All this have they beheld without revolt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And borne the brunt in agonizing prayer.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For other strains of blood that flow from times<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Older than Egypt, whence the dark man gave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rudiments of learning to all lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have been a strong constraint. And they have dreamed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a peculiar mission under heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And felt the force of unexampled gifts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That make for them a rare inheritance&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gift of cheerful confidence in man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gift of calm endurance, solacing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An infinite capacity for pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gift of an unfeigned humility,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blinding the eyes of strident arrogance<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_136" id="page_136">{136}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bigot pride to that philosophy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that far-glancing wisdom which it veils,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of joy in beauty, hardihood in toil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of hope in tribulation, and of wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adaptive power without a parallel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In chronicles of men.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>A sonnet entitled <i>To a Caged Canary in a Negro Restaurant</i> will present
the poet’s people with the persuasiveness of pathos as the foregoing
poem with the persuasiveness of reason:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thou little golden bird of happy song!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cage cannot restrain the rapturous joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which thou dost shed abroad. Thou dost employ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy bondage for high uses. Grievous wrong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is thine; yet in thy heart glows full and strong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tropic sun, though far beyond thy flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though thou flutterest there by day and night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the clamor of a dusky throng.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So let my will, albeit hedged about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By creed and caste, feed on the light within;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So let my song sing through the bars of doubt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With light and healing where despair has been;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So let my people bide their time and place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hindered but a sunny-hearted race.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>It would be an injustice to this poet did I convey the idea that his
seventy-odd poems are exclusively occupied with race wrongs and
oppression. Not a few of them bear no stamp of an oppressed or afflicted
spirit, though of sorrow they may have been nurtured.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_137" id="page_137">{137}</a></span></p>

<p>A lyric of pure loveliness is the following, entitled</p>

<p class="cpom">TO A NOBLY-GIFTED SINGER</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All the pleasance of her face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Telleth of an inward grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In her dark eyes I have seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sorrows of the Nazarene;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the proud and perfect mould<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her body I behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rounded in a single view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The good, the beautiful, the true;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when her spirit goes up-winging<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On sweet airs of artless singing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surely the heavenly spheres rejoice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In union with a kindred voice.<br /></span>

<p>Schoolmaster I said Mr. Hill was. To represent his didactic quality, not
his purer lyrical note, nor yet his narrative beauty, I choose the
following piece:</p>

<p>But though teacher Leslie Pinckney Hill is singer too. And though he has
a message for America he also has music. His powers are rich, varied,
cultured, and developing. His second book will be better than his
excellent first.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_139" id="page_139">{139}</a></span></p>

<p>Though the moral motive is rarely consistent with the artistic, yet in
the next poem of Miss Jessye’s I shall give there is a perfect
reconciliation. Original no doubt is the idea of this poem, but Sappho,
it seems to me, as one of her fragments bears witness, had meditated
upon the very same idea twenty-five centuries ago.</p>

<p>Miss Jessye, now a teacher of the piano in Muskogee, Oklahoma, was born
in Kansas and was graduated from Western University. She has taken
prizes in oratory, poetry, and essay-writing. Yet in her early twenties,
she has a volume of verse ready for publication.</p>

<p>Self-taught, and disclaiming knowledge of books, Mrs. Hammond of Omaha,

cadences and gentle beauty. Her response to the scenes and objects of

verses. As a representative poem the following may be accepted:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_143" id="page_143">{143}</a></span></p>

<h4><i>III. Mrs. Alice Dunbar-Nelson</i></h4>

<p>A sonnet has already been given from Mrs. Dunbar-Nelson to which I think
Mrs. Browning or Christina Rossetti might have appended her signature
without detriment to her fame. It is one of a series entitled <i>A Dream
Sequence</i>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_145" id="page_145">{145}</a></span> rest of the sequence being as yet unpublished. Instead
of pillaging this sequence, marring the effect of the individual member
so dislocated, I will take from her compilation, <i>The Dunbar
Speaker</i>,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> so named for her first husband, the poet, two of her
original poems. The first is a war poem, doubtless, but the occasion is
immaterial. The spirit of rebellion against confinement to the petty
thing while the something big calls afar might be evoked into play by
any of a hundred situations.</p>

<p>The second poem I shall give is also not unrelated to the recent World
War, and to all war: the lights alluded to, shining across and down the
Delaware for miles, are the lights of the DuPont powder mills. It is a

meaning&mdash;a poem that will bear and repay many readings, never growing
less beautiful.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunbar-Nelson has not applied herself to poetry as she has to prose

<h4><i>IV. Mrs. Georgia Douglas Johnson</i></h4>

</div>

<p>Exquisite artistry in verse, with infallible poetic content, is
exhibited in Mrs. Georgia Douglas Johnson’s <i>The Heart of a Woman</i>. It
is also the saddest book produced by her race. Perfect lyrical notes,
the most poignant pathos&mdash;that is an exact description of it. Triple
bronze cannot armor any breast successfully against its appeal. For the
heart that speaks here is a heart that has known its garden of sorrows,
its Gethsemane. This is the harvest of her sorrows&mdash;dreams and songs, of
which she comments:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The dreams of the dreamer<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Are life-drops that pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The break in the heart<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the Soul’s hour-glass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_149" id="page_149">{149}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The songs of the singer<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Are tones that repeat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cry of the heart<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till it ceases to beat.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Neither in memory nor in dreams is there a refuge for the life-wounded
heart of this woman:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What need have I for memory,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When not a single flower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has bloomed within life’s desert<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For me, one little hour?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What need have I for memory,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whose burning eyes have met<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The corse of unborn happiness<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Winding the trail regret?<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>And thus of her dreams, on the last page of her book:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I am folding up my little dreams<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Within my heart to-night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And praying I may soon forget<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The torture of their sight.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>What are the experiences and what the conditions of life&mdash;what must they
have been&mdash;which have had the tragic power to make a soul “try to forget
it has dreamed of stars?” The world little kens what hearts in it are
breaking, and why. To the grave the secret goes with the many, one in a
million betrays it in a cry. But not here is it betrayed:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_150" id="page_150">{150}</a></span></p>

<p class="cpom">SMOTHERED FIRES</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A woman with a burning flame<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Deep covered through the years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ashes&mdash;ah! she hid it deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And smothered it with tears.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sometimes a baleful light would rise<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From out the dusky bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then the woman hushed it quick<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To slumber on, as dead.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At last the weary war was done,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The tapers were alight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with a sigh of victory<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She breathed a soft&mdash;goodnight!<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Not without hurt to itself may the oyster produce its pearl. These poems
from the heart of a woman remind me of nothing so much as a string of
pearls. Each one is witness to a bruise or gash to the spirit. The lyric
cry has not been more piercing in anything written on American soil,
piercing all the more for the perfect restraint, the sure artistry. It
was a heart surcharged with sorrow in which these pearls of poesy took
shape from secret wounds. The heart of one woman speaks in them for
thousands in America, else inarticulate. “We weep,” says the African
proverb, “we weep in our hearts like the tortoise.” Without one word or
hint of race in all the book there is yet between its covers the
unwritten,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_151" id="page_151">{151}</a></span> unwritable tragedy of that borderland race which knows not
where it belongs in the world, a truly homeless race in soul. A sadder
book could hardly be.</p>

<p>Mrs. Georgia Douglas Johnson was born in Atlanta, Georgia, and received
her academic education in Atlanta University and a musical education at
Oberlin. She now lives in Washington, D. C. She is at the beginning of
her career as an author. Two other books of lyrics, under the titles of
<i>An Autumn Love Cycle</i>, and <i>Bronze</i>,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> she has in preparation for the
press at this time. Some of their contents have already appeared in
magazines. These two new volumes will make an advance in power and in
richness of content beyond <i>The Heart of a Woman</i>. They will also
provide the key to the tragic mystery concealed in that book. A poem
that is to appear in <i>Bronze</i> will be given in a later chapter. I will
here give another. Both have already been published in magazines.</p>

</div>

<p>Not less distinctive in quality than Mrs. Johnson’s, and not less
beautiful in artistry, are the brief lyrics of Miss Angelina W. Grimké,
also of the city of Washington. If hers should be called imagist poetry
or no I cannot say, but I am certain that more vivid imaging of objects
has not been done in verse by any contemporary. This, too, in stanzas
that suggest in their perfection of form the work of the old lapidaries.
Nor is there but a surface or formal beauty. There is passion, there is
beauty of idea, the soul of lyric poetry is there as well as the form. I
am weighing well my words in giving this praise, and I know that not<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_153" id="page_153">{153}</a></span>
one in the thousand of those who write good verse would deserve them.
But I ask the sceptical individual to re-read them after he has perused
the poems themselves.</p>

<p class="nind">life the Negro woman’s heart offers difficulties peculiar to itself.
These various writers&mdash;talented, cultured, with the keen sensibilities
of a specially sensitive people&mdash;have given us glimpses into some of the
depths, not all. A poet of the other sex, Mr. McKay, with that
divination which belongs to the poet, intimates in <i>The Harlem Dancer</i>,
quoted on page 128, that the index of the heart is not always in the
occupation or the face:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But, looking at her falsely-smiling face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knew her self was not in that strange place.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>No, her self was free and too noble to be smirched by the “passionate
gaze of wine-flushed, bold-eyed boys.” It is a paradox that has puzzled
a recent white novelist. Cissie Dildine, in Mr. Stribling’s
<i>Birthright</i>, pilferer though she is, and sacrificer of her maidenhood,
yet does not lose caste among her people. They speak affectionately of
her and minister lovingly to her in jail, with no hint of re<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_158" id="page_158">{158}</a></span>proach. It
is not other standards, as the novelist intimates, that we must apply,
but only right standards, in view of circumstances.</p>

<p>I am able to give here a poem that may start in the reader’s mind a
fruitful train of reflections, tending toward profound ethical truth.
The writer, Mrs. Anne Spencer of Lynchburg, Virginia, in all of her work
that I have seen, has marked originality. Her style is independent,
unconventional, and highly compressed. The poem which follows will
fairly represent her work and at the same time open another avenue to
the secret chambers of the Negro woman’s heart:</p>

<p>By way of indicating the idealistic aspirations of the colored people I
gave at the end of Chapter I. J. Mord Allen’s poem <i>The Psalm of the
Uplift</i>. For the same purpose I will give here, at the end of this
chapter, a poem of the very present day from one of the most
accomplished young women of the Negro race. Besides its intrinsic merit
as a poem it has the further recommendation for a place in this chapter
that it celebrates a woman of the black race who was the very embodiment
of its noblest qualities&mdash;illiterate slave though she was. It is a
splendid testimonial to her people of this later day that Negro
literature is filled with tributes to Sojourner Truth. She was indeed a
wonderful woman, altogether worthy to be ranked with the noble heroines
of biblical story. From a Negro historian I take the following
restrained account of her:<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_161" id="page_161">{161}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Two Negroes, because of their unusual gifts, stood out with great
prominence in the agitation. These were Sojourner Truth and
Frederick Douglass. Sojourner Truth was born of slave parents about
1798 in Ulster County, New York. She remembered vividly in later
years the cold, wet cellar-room in which slept the slaves of the
family to which she belonged, and where she was taught by her
mother to repeat the Lord’s Prayer and to trust in God at all
times. When in the course of gradual emancipation in New York she
became legally free in 1827, her master refused to comply with the
law. She left, but was pursued and found. Rather than have her go
back, a friend paid for her services for the rest of the year. Then
came an evening when, searching for one of her children that had
been stolen and sold, she found herself a homeless wanderer. A
Quaker family gave her lodging for the night. Subsequently she went
to New York City, joined a Methodist Church, and worked hard to
improve her condition. Later, having decided to leave New York for
a lecturing tour through the East, she made a small bundle of her
belongings and informed a friend that her name was no longer
Isabella but Sojourner. She went on her way, lecturing to people
where she found them assembled and being entertained in many
aristocratic homes. She was entirely untaught in the schools, but
she was witty, original, and always suggestive. By her tact and her
gift of song she kept down ridicule, and by her fervor and faith
she won many friends for the anti-slavery cause. As to her name she
said: “And the Lord gave me Sojourner because I was to travel up
an’ down the land showin<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_162" id="page_162">{162}</a></span>’ the people their sins an’ bein’ a sign
unto them. Afterwards I told the Lord I wanted another name, ’cause
everybody else had two names, an’ the Lord gave me Truth, because I
was to declare the truth to the people.”</p></div>

<p>The poem follows, with the author’s note on the saying of Sojourner
Truth which occasioned it:</p>

<p class="cpom">ORIFLAMME</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I can remember when I was a little, young girl, how my old mammy
would sit out of doors in the evenings and look up at the stars and
groan, and I would say, ‘Mammy, what makes you groan so?’ And she
would say, ‘I am groaning to think of my poor children; they do not
know where I be and I don’t know where they be. I look up at the
stars and they look up at the stars!’&mdash;Sojourner Truth.</p></div>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I think I see her sitting bowed and black,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Stricken and seared with slavery’s mortal scars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reft of her children, lonely, anguished, yet<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Still looking at the stars.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

</div>

<p>“Still visioning the stars”&mdash;that is the idealism of the Negro. The soul
of Sojourner Truth goes marching on, star-led.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_163" id="page_163">{163}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has not frequently happened in these times that a poet has dated a
poem from a prison cell, or dedicated a book of poems to the judge of a
police court. Mr. Edward Smythe Jones, however, has done this, and there
is an interesting story by way of explanation. From the poem alluded to
it seems that Mr. Jones in his over-mastering desire to drink at the
Harvard fountain of learning tramped out of the Southland up to
Cambridge. Arriving travel-worn, friendless, moneyless, hungry, he was
preparing to bivouac on the Harvard campus his first night in the
University city,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_164" id="page_164">{164}</a></span> when, being misunderstood, and not believed, he was
apprehended as a vagabond and thrown into jail. A poem, however, the
poem which tells this story, delivered him. The judge was convinced by
it, kindly entreated the prisoner, and set him free to return to the
academic shades. <i>Ad astra per aspera.</i></p>

<p>It was in “Cell No. 40, East Cambridge Jail, Cambridge, Massachusetts,
July 26, 1910,” that the unlucky bard committed to verse this story,
transmuting harsh experience to the joy of artistic production. The last
half of his version runs as follows:</p>

<p>Of all the Negro poets whose writings I have perused, Edward Smythe
Jones is the most difficult to estimate with certainty. There is an
eloquence and luxuriance of language and imagery in his stanzas which
perplexes the critic and yet persuades him to repeated readings. The
result,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_167" id="page_167">{167}</a></span> however, fails to become clear. If, with his copiousness, the
reserve of disciplined art ever becomes his, and his critical faculty is
trained to match his creative, then poetry of noteworthy merit may be
expected from him. His deeply religious bent, his aspiration after the
best things of the mind, his ambition to treat lofty themes, augur well
for him.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones’s two best poems, <i>The Sylvan Cabin: A Centenary Ode on the
Birth of Abraham Lincoln</i> and <i>An Ode to Ethiopia: to the Aspiring Negro
Youth</i>, are too long for insertion here. I will give a shorter patriotic
ode, not included in his book, but written, I believe, during the World
War:</p>

<p>Is there, in all our American poetry, a more eloquent apostrophe to our
flag than that, not excepting even Joseph Rodman Drake’s? Perhaps the
allusion to Attucks in the first stanza will require a note for the
white reader. Every colored school-child, however, knows that Crispus
Attucks was a brave and stalwart Negro, who, in the van of the patriots
of Boston that resisted the British soldiers in the so-called “Boston
Massacre,” March 5, 1770, fell with two British bullets in his breast,
among the first martyrs for independence:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus Attucks brave, without a moment’s pause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full bared his breast in Freedom’s holy cause,<br /></span>

<p class="nind">so writes of him this same poet in his <i>Ode to Ethiopia</i>.</p>

<h4><i>II. Raymond Garfield Dandridge</i></h4>

<p>Twelve years ago a young house-decorator in Cincinnati was stricken down
with partial paralysis, since which time he has been bedfast and all but
helpless. On this bed of distress he learned what resources were within
himself, powers that in health he knew not of. The fountain of poetry
sprang up in what threatened to be a desert life.&mdash;The artist-nature
within manifested itself in a new realm, the realm of words set to
tuneful measures. This artisan, turned by affliction into a poet, is
Raymond Garfield Dandridge. Again, <i>ad astra per aspera</i>.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Raymond G. Dandridge</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>It is not great poetry that Dandridge is giving to the world, but it is
poetry. His musings shaped into rhyme reach the heart. They have
sweetness and light&mdash;“the two most precious things in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_170" id="page_170">{170}</a></span> world.” All
the art he has acquired, untaught, from his reading and unaided
thinking. Naturally one would not expect that art to be flawless. His
initial poem, while not literally a self-description, will serve to
introduce this adopted son of the lyric Muse:</p>

<p class="cpom">THE POET</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The poet sits and dreams and dreams;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He scans his verse; he probes his themes.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then turns to stretch or stir about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest, like his thoughts, his strength give out.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then off to bed, for he must rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cord some wood, or tamp some ties,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Or break a field of fertile soil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or do some other manual toil.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He dare not live by wage of pen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most poorly paid of poor paid men,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">And editors among the foes<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who mock his song, deny him bread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then sing his praise when he is dead.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>A secret consolation is intimated in the following lines:</p>

<p class="cpom">TO&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Though many are the dreams I dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They’re born within a single theme.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same kind voice I ever hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instilling faith, upbraiding fear:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_171" id="page_171">{171}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same consoling smile appears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To snuff my sighs and dry my tears:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fondest heart, of purest gold,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And pray naught ever change my theme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or wake me from my dream.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Reflections upon the deeper meanings of life and death are inevitable to
one situated as Mr. Dandridge is, provided he is given to serious
reflections at all. And the thoughts of such a person are apt to have
value for their sincerity. Two brief meditations in rhyme, as we may
call them, will represent his thinking on such themes:</p>

<p class="cpom">TIME TO DIE</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Black Brother, think you life so sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That you would live at any price?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The weight of your great sacrifice?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, can it be you fear the grave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enough to live and die a slave?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, Brother! be it better said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When you are gone and tears are shed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That your death was the stepping stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your children’s children cross’d upon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men have died that men might live:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look every foeman in the eye!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If necessary, your life give<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For something, ere in vain you die.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_172" id="page_172">{172}</a></span></div></div>
</div>

<p class="cpom">ETERNITY</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Vast realm beyond the gate of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where craven scavengers and kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alike, with passing final breath,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Wander at will, in peace, perchance&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perchance in strife, who dare would say?<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Even in the confinement to which his affliction has subjected him, Mr.
Dandridge has felt the strong pulse-throbs of his people’s new kindled
aspirations. The strength of the soul may indeed increase with the
weakness of the body. These lines are surely not wanting in the passion
without which “facts” are cold:</p>

<h4><i>III. George Marion McClellan</i></h4>

<div class="figright" style="width: 197px;"><a name="ill_029" id="ill_029"></a>
<a href="images/i_173_lg.jpg">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">George Marion McClellan</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Aptly has Mr. McClellan entitled his book of poems <i>The Path of Dreams</i>.
A dreamer is he and the home of his spirit is dreamland:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sweet-scented winds move inward from the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Blythe is the air of June with silken gleams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My roving fancy treads at will once more<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The golden path of dreams.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">And that path leads the poet ever back to the golden days of his youth,
when Southern suns and Southern moons steeped his very being in dreams
and Southern birds gave him their melodies and Southern mountains lifted
his soul heavenward. A wanderer upon the earth he appears to have been,
and as all wanderers’ hearts turn back to some loved region or spot so
his to Dixie. Seldom has the longing for distant, remembered scenes, for
spring’s returning and for summer’s glow, been more sweetly expressed in
rhyme than in the various poems of <i>The Path of Dreams</i>. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_174" id="page_174">{174}</a></span> yet,
sweeter songs than those are locked up in his breast, not to be sung:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The summer sweetness fills my heart with songs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot sing, with loves I cannot speak.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">When harsh necessity imprisons him in the city he sighs:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I think the sight of fields and shady lanes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would ease my heart of pains.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">But what contradictions poets have ever found in their experiences! The
ministrants of joy but wring the cry of pain from the yearning heart.
Lovely May is harder to endure, in exile, than gloomy December. The
city’s discordant cries may be endured, bringing neither grief nor joy,
while a bird’s carol may be exquisite torture:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The woodlark’s tender warbling lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which flows with melting art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is but a trembling song of love<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That serves to break my heart.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">Musing on whatever scene, the poet’s thoughts are tinged with that
sadness which to every sensitive nature has a sweetness in it:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The sun went down in beauty,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While I stood musing alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood watching the rushing river<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And heard its restless moan;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_175" id="page_175">{175}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Longings, vague, intenable,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So far from speech apart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the endless rush of the river,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Went surging through my heart.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>With no less sadness or beauty, and with that philosophy towards which
poetry ever has a bias, our poet of dreams thus reflects, on watching
the ephemera that dart with glimmering wings in keen delight where the
breezes fling the sweets of May:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Creatures of gauze and velvet wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With a day of gleams and flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who knows&mdash;in the light of eternal things&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Your life is less than ours?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Weary at last, it is ours, like you,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When our brief day is done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Folding our hands, to say adieu,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And pass with the setting sun.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>One must say of George Marion McClellan: “Here is a finely touched
spirit that responds deeply to the mystery and charm of mountains and
starry skies, and that charm and mystery he is capable of expressing in
stanzas of lyric beauty.” Every page of his book will confirm for the
reader the estimate he may have formed from the quotations already
given. Without rifling it of its choicest treasures I will put before
the reader a few entire poems which I am sure will give increased
delight on repeated readings:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_176" id="page_176">{176}</a></span></p>

<h4><i>V. Leon R. Harris</i></h4>

<p>Now editor of the Richmond (Indiana) <i>Blade</i>, contributor of
short-stories to <i>The Century Magazine</i>, an honored citizen and the head
of a respected family, Leon R. Harris was an orphan asylum’s ward. Most
splendidly has he, yet in his early thirties, illustrated the old adage
chosen as a heading for this chapter. His father, a roving musician,
took no interest in the future poet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_181" id="page_181">{181}</a></span> His mother died and left him
almost in the cradle. The orphanage which became his refuge gave him at
least food, shelter, and schooling to the fourth grade. Then he was
given to a Kentucky family to be reared. It was virtual slavery, and the
boy ran away from over-work and beatings. Making his escape to
Cincinnati he was befriended by a traveling salesman and began to find
himself. At eleven years of age, some of his verses were printed in a
Cincinnati daily with “Author Unknown” attached. He now made his way to
Berea and worked his way for two years in that good old college. Then
for three years he worked his way in Tuskegee.</p>

</div>

<p>We next find him in Iowa, married; then in North Carolina, teaching
school; then in Ohio, working in steel mills. This last was his
employment until about two years ago. His short stories and poems are
right out of his life. In the former the peonage system, prevalent in
some sections of the South, and the cruelties of the convict labor<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_182" id="page_182">{182}</a></span>
camps are more powerfully portrayed than anywhere else in American
literature. The following poem will represent his writings in verse:</p>

<p>Intrinsic merit is in that poem, apart from the circumstance of its
being written by a workman himself. As an interpretation of the life of
his fellow-workmen&mdash;their imaginative, inner life&mdash;it is a human
document to be reflected upon. As for the artistic quality of the verses
they place you in imagination amid the sights and sounds described and
they have something in them suggestive of the steel bars the men are
making.</p>

<h4><i>VI. Irvin W. Underhill</i></h4>

<p>In what strange disguises comes ofttimes the call to nobler things! Our
happiness not seldom springs out of seeming misfortune. An illustration
is afforded by Mr. Irvin W. Underhill, of Philadelphia, to whom
blindness brought a more glorious seeing&mdash;the seeing of truth, of
greater meaning in life, of greater beauty in the world. Out of this new
vision springs a corresponding message in verse, a message not of
bitterness for<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_185" id="page_185">{185}</a></span></p>

a bitter loss, but of love, and exhortation, and encouragement. Blind,
he lives in the Light. In his little book, entitled <i>Daddy’s Love and

beauty. Because of its sage counsel, however, I pass over some of these
lovelier expressions of sentiment and choose a didactic piece:</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">II. ad astra</span></h3>

<h4><i>I. James C. Hughes</i></h4>

<p>There are tragic stories of Negro aspirants for poetic fame that read
like the old stories of English poets in London in the days when the
children of genius starved and died young. As typical of not a few there
is the story of James C. Hughes, of Louisville, Kentucky. The Louisville
<i>Times</i>, March 10, 1905, contained his picture and an article by Joseph
S. Cotter in appreciation of his compositions. “This young man,” writes
Cotter, speaking of a collection of verses and prose sketches which
Hughes then had ready for publication, “this young man has the
essentials of the poet, and to me his work is interesting. It is
serious, and preaches while it sings.”</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>To illustrate the range and quality of Hughes I will quote from this
article two selections, one in prose and one in dialect verse:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_188" id="page_188">{188}</a></span></p>

<p class="cpom">ASPIRATION</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“True love is the same to-day as when the vestal virgins held their
mystic lights along the path of virtue. Virtue wears the same
vesture that she wore upon the ancient plain that led to fame
immortal. Now the royal gates of honor stand ajar for men of
courage, souls who will not time their spirit-lyre to suit the
common chord. Our nation has known men who held within their palms
our country’s destiny: and, smiling in the armor of a fearless
truth, have thrown away their lives. Awake, O countrymen, awake,
this noble flame. The gods will fan it, and the world shall burn
with honor and pure love.”</p></div>

<p>The bit of dialect verse follows, taken from a poem entitled <i>Apology
for Wayward Jim</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“You has offen tole us, Massy,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So’s we’d keep on bein’ free.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Please do’ whip ole Jim dis time, suh;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marse, I ’no’s you’s good an’ kind;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">We wuz free foreber mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_189" id="page_189">{189}</a></span>’.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Long’s a human soul’s a slabe, suh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ain’t no way to make it free.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The young author of these selections, failing to get his book published,
lost his mind and “disappeared from view.” So ends his story.</p>

<h4><i>II. Leland Milton Fisher</i></h4>

<p>Another sad story, more frequently repeated in the lives of the writers
represented in this book, is that of Leland Milton Fisher. First I shall
give one of his poems, as passionately sweet a lyric as can be found in
American literature:</p>

<p class="cpom">FOR YOU, SWEETHEART</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For you, sweetheart, I’d have your skies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As bright as are your own bright eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all your day-dreams warm and fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As is the sunshine in your hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Fates to you should be as kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As are the thoughts in your pure mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every bird I’d have impart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its sweetest song to you, sweetheart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_190" id="page_190">{190}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For you, sweetheart, I’d have each dart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sorrow fashions for your tender heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrust in my own thrice happy breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That yours might have unbroken rest.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If you should fall asleep and lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So very still and quiet that I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would know your soul had slipped away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From your divinely molded clay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, looking in your fair, sweet face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’d pray to God: “In thy good grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, Father, let me sleep, nor wake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again on earth, for her dear sake.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Born in Humbolt, Tennessee, in 1875, Fisher died of tuberculosis, ere
yet thirty years of age, leaving behind an unpublished volume of poems.</p>

<h4><i>III. W. Clarence Jordan</i></h4>

<p>In another chapter I have written of a poet whose birthplace was
Bardstown, Kentucky. W. Clarence Jordan, a Negro schoolmaster of
Bardstown, now dead, wrote the following lines in answer to the
questions, so frequently asked in derision, which stands as its title:</p>

<p class="cpom">WHAT IS THE NEGRO DOING?</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As we pass along life’s highway,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Day by day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thousands daily ask the question,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">“What, I pray,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_191" id="page_191">{191}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell me what’s the Negro doing?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what course is he pursuing?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What achievements is he strewing<br /></span>
<span class="i4">By the way?”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Many say he’s retrograding<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Very fast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Others say his glory’s fading,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Cannot last;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That his prospects now are blighted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That his chances have been slighted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This his wrongs cannot be righted.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Time has passed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Friends, lift up your eyes; look higher;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Higher still.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There’s the vanguard of our army<br /></span>
<span class="i4">On the hill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You’ve been looking at the rear guard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lift your eyes, look farther forward;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thousands are still pressing starward&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Ever will.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<h4><i>IV. Roscoe C. Jamison</i></h4>

<p>Roscoe C. Jamison was fortunate in leaving behind him a friend at his
early death, some three years since, who treasured his fugitive verses
sufficiently to gather them together, though but a handful, and send
them out to the world in a little pamphlet. Fortunate also was he in
another friend able to write his elegy:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_192" id="page_192">{192}</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Too soon is hushed his silver speech,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The music dies upon his lute,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cadence falls beyond our reach;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Too soon the Poet’s lips are mute.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 198px;"><a name="ill_032" id="ill_032"></a>
<a href="images/i_192_lg.jpg">
<img src="images/i_192_sml.jpg" width="198" height="262" alt="[Image unavailable.]" /></a>
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Roscoe C. Jamison</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>So wrote in this elegy, <i>Lacrimae Aethiopiae</i>, Charles Bertram Johnson,
of this untimely dead singer. Hardly a score of poems are in this
pamphlet, yet enough are here to reveal a poet in the making. Jamison
was a better poet, even in these imperfect pieces, than many a writer of
better verses. Here are the ardent impulses and here are the glowing
ideas from which poetry of the higher order springs. The art, however,
is undisciplined, grammar, metre, and rhymes are sometimes at fault.
However, bold strokes of poetry atone, the effects are the effects of a
real poet. Sometimes one finds in the small collection a poem that is
all but perfect, a production that might have come from a maturer
craftsman. I venture to put him to the test in the following poem:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_193" id="page_193">{193}</a></span></p>

<p class="cpom">CASTLES IN THE AIR</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I build my castles in the air.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How beautiful they seem to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Standing in all their glory there,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like stars above the sea!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I watch them with admiring eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For in them dwells life’s fondest hope:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If they be swept from out the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In darkness I must grope.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They hold life’s joys, life’s sweetest dreams;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They make the weary years seem bright.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one guided by bright starbeams<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I struggle through the night.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sometimes from out the skies they fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And my soul shrieks in its pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But from the heights I hear Hope’s call,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Arise and build again.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What though life be with sorrow filled<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And each day brings its load of care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’m happy still while I can build<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My castles in the air!<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Who but will say, despite the metrical defects, this is a real poem?
Another poem will show his art at a better advantage, while the pathos
is of another kind, very touching pathos it is, too:</p>

<p class="cpom">A SONG</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I loved you, Dear. I did not know how much,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until the silence of the Grave lay cold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between us, and your hand I could not touch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And your sweet face, oh! never more behold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_194" id="page_194">{194}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I loved you, Dear. I did not know how true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until in other eyes I found no light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know&mdash;alas!&mdash;my Spirit without you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must drift forever in a starless night!<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>A different kind of merit, the merit of intense reprobation of cruel
arrogancy in the one race and of treacherous cowardice in the other, is
exemplified in <i>The Edict</i>. Triumphant faith, which is the Negro’s
peculiar heritage, asserts itself in such a way, in the final stanza, as
to lift the poem to the heights of moral feeling.</p>

<p class="cpom">THE EDICT</p>

<p>If lyric poetry be self-revealment&mdash;and such it is, or it is nothing&mdash;we
can learn from the following poem how deep a sorrow at some time in his
life this poet must have experienced:</p>

<p class="cpom">HOPELESSNESS</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Had you called from the fire, or from the sea,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To perish with thee if I could not save.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But now helpless I sit and watch you die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is no power can save, the doctors say;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I lift my eyes unto the silent sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wonder why it is that mortals pray.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The title-poem of the booklet, <i>Negro Soldiers</i>, is no doubt Jamison’s
masterpiece. It is worthy of the universal admiration it has won from

particularly not many noteworthy pieces have come from Negro poets. Well
or ill, each may judge according to his taste. But the objection has
been made that the Negro verse-makers of our time are bound by
tradition, are sophisticated craftsmen. More independence, more
differentness, seems to be demanded. But the conditions of their poetic
activity seem to me in this demand to be lost sight of. They are as much
the heirs of Palgrave’s Golden Treasury as their white contemporaries.
And the Negro is said to be preëminently imitative&mdash;that is, responsive
to environing example and influence. One requirement and only one can we
lay upon the Negro singer and that is the same we lay upon the artists
of every race and origin. However, for artistic freedom he has an
authority older than free-verse, and that authority is not outside his
own race. It is found in the old plantation melodies&mdash;rich in artistic
potentiality beyond exaggeration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_197" id="page_197">{197}</a></span></p>

<h3>I. FREE-VERSE</h3>

<p>In Negro newspapers and magazines, rarely as yet in books, are to be
found some free-verse productions of which I will give some specimens.
From Will Sexton I shall quote here two brief poems in this form and in
a later chapter another (p. 233). His Whitemanesque manner will be
remarked. These brief pieces will suggest a poet of some force:</p>

<h4><i>Songs of Contemporary Ethiopia</i></h4>

<p class="cpom">THE BOMB THROWER</p>

</div>

<p class="cpom">THE NEW NEGRO</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Out of the mist I see a new America&mdash;a land of ideals.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hear the music of my fathers blended with the “Stars and Stripes Forever.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am the crown of thorns Tyranny must bear a thousand years&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am the New Negro.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Another vers-librist of individual quality is Andrea Razafkeriefo. He is
a prolific contributor to <i>The Negro World</i>, the newspaper organ of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_198" id="page_198">{198}</a></span>
Universal Negro Improvement Society. This paper regularly gives a
considerable portion of a page of each issue to original verse
contributions. One of Mr. Razafkeriefo’s recent free-verse poems is the
following, in which the style seems to me to be remarkably effective:</p>

<p class="cpom">THE NEGRO CHURCH</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>In another chapter I give one of Mr. Razafkeriefo’s poems in regular
stanzas of the traditional type. It is but just to state that his
productions exhibit a great variety of forms. His moods and traits, too,
are various. There is the evidence of ardent feeling and strong
conviction in most he writes.</p>

</div>

<p>This poet gets his strange name (pronounced rä-zäf-ker-rāf) from the
island of Madagascar. His father, now dead, “falling in battle for
Malagasy freedom,” before the poet’s birth, was a nephew of the late
queen of Madagascar, Ranavalona III. His mother, a colored American, was
a daughter of a United States con<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_200" id="page_200">{200}</a></span>sul to Madagascar. The poet was born
in the city of Washington in 1895 and now resides in Cleveland, Ohio.</p>

<p>To a young student in Columbia University we are indebted for some of
the most symmetrical and effective free-verse poems that have come to my
attention. His name is Langston Hughes. For information about him I
refer the reader to the first index, at the end of this book. This poem
appeared in <i>The Crisis</i>, January, 1922:</p>

<p>Other specimens of free-verse have been given on pages 67, 102, and 119.
In every instance the poet’s choice of this form seems to me justified
by the particular effectiveness of it.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">II. Prose Poems</span></h3>

<h4><i>I. W. E. Burghardt DuBois</i></h4>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">W. E. B. DuBois</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The name of no Negro author is more widely known than that of W. E.
Burghardt DuBois. Editor, historian, sociologist, essayist, poet&mdash;he is
celebrated in the Five Continents and the Seven Seas. It is in his
impassioned prose that DuBois is most a poet. <i>The Souls of Black Folk</i>
throbs constantly on the verge of poetry, while the several chapters of
<i>Darkwater</i> end with a litany, chant, or credo, rhapsodical in character
and in free-verse form.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_202" id="page_202">{202}</a></span> In all this work Dr. DuBois is the spokesman of
perhaps as many millions of souls as any man living.</p>

<p>“A Litany at Atlanta,” placed as an epilogue to “The Shadow of the
Years” in <i>Darkwater</i>,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> should be read as the litany of a race. Modern
literature has not such another cry of agony:</p>

<p>A city lay in travail, God our Lord, and from her loins sprang twin
Murder and Black Hate. Red was the midnight; clang, crack, and cry of

<p>Dr. Kelly Miller is professor of sociology in Howard University. He has
been professor of mathematics. He is the author of several prose
works&mdash;able expositions of aspects of inter-racial problems. It is
rumored that he is a poet. However that may be, his admirable volume of
essays entitled <i>Out of the House of Bondage</i> concludes with a strophic
chant, highly poetical, and poured forth with the fervor of some old
Celtic bard, triumphant in the vision of a new day dawning:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_207" id="page_207">{207}</a></span></p>

<p class="cpom">I SEE AND AM SATISFIED</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The vision of a scion of a despised and rejected race, the span of whose
life is measured by the years of its Golden Jubilee, and whose fancy,
like the vine that girdles the tree-trunk, runneth both forward and
back.</p>
</div>

<p class="hang1">I see the African savage as he drinks his palmy wine, and basks in
the sunshine of his native bliss, and is happy.</p>

<p class="hang1">I see the man-catcher, impelled by thirst of gold, as he entraps
his simple-souled victim in the snares of bondage and death, by use
of force or guile.</p>

<p class="hang1">I see the ocean basin whitened with his bones, and the ocean
current running red with his blood, amidst the hellish horrors of
the middle passage.</p>

<p class="hang1">I see him laboring for two centuries and a half in unrequited toil,
making the hillsides of our southland to glow with the snow-white
fleece of cotton, and the valleys to glisten with the golden
sheaves of grain.</p>

<p class="hang1">I see him silently enduring cruelty and torture indescribable, with
flesh flinching beneath the sizz of angry whip or quivering under
the gnaw of the sharp-toothed bloodhound.</p>

<p class="hang1">I see a chivalric civilization instinct with dignity, comity and
grace rising upon pillars supported by his strength and brawny arm.</p>

<p class="hang1">I see the swarthy matron lavishing her soul in altruistic devotion
upon the offspring of her alabaster mistress.</p>

<p class="hang1">I see the haughty sons of a haughty race pouring out their lustful
passion upon black womanhood, filling our land with a bronzed and
tawny brood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_208" id="page_208">{208}</a></span></p>

<p class="hang1">I see also the patriarchal solicitude of the kindly-hearted owners
of men, in whose breast not even iniquitous system could sour the
milk of human kindness.</p>

<p class="hang1">I hear the groans, the sorrows, the sighings, the soul striving of
these benighted creatures of God, rising up from the low grounds of
sorrow and reaching the ear of Him Who regardeth man of the
lowliest estate.</p>

<p class="hang1">I strain my ear to supernal sound, and I hear in the secret
chambers of the Almighty the order to the Captain of Host to break
his bond and set him free.</p>

<p class="hang1">I see Abraham Lincoln, himself a man of sorrows and acquainted with
grief, arise to execute the high decree.</p>

<p class="hang1">I see two hundred thousand black boys in blue baring their breasts
to the bayonets of the enemy, that their race might have some
slight part in its own deliverance.</p>

<p class="hang1">I see the great Proclamation delivered in the year of my birth of
which I became the first fruit and beneficiary.</p>

<p class="hang1">I see the assassin striking down the great Emancipator; and the
house of mirth is transformed into the Golgotha of the nation.</p>

<p class="hang1">I watch the Congress as it adds to the Constitution new words,
which make the document a charter of liberty indeed.</p>

<p class="hang1">I see the new-made citizen running to and fro in the first fruit of
his new-found freedom.</p>

<p class="hang1">I see him rioting in the flush of privilege which the nation had
vouchsafed, but destined, alas, not long to last.</p>

<p class="hang1">I see him thrust down from the high seat of political<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_209" id="page_209">{209}</a></span> power, by
fraud and force, while the nation looks on in sinister silence and
acquiescent guilt.</p>

<p class="hang1">I see the tide of public feeling run cold and chilly, as the vial
of racial wrath is wreaked upon his bowed and defenceless head.</p>

<p class="hang1">I see his body writhing in the agony of death as his groans issue
from the crackling flames, while the funeral pyre lights the
midnight sky with its dismal glare. My heart sinks with heaviness
within me.</p>

<p class="hang1">I see that the path of progress has never taken a straight line,
but has always been a zigzag course amid the conflicting forces of
right and wrong, truth and error, justice and injustice, cruelty
and mercy.</p>

<p class="hang1">I see that the great generous American Heart, despite the temporary
flutter, will finally beat true to the higher human impulse, and my
soul abounds with reassurance and hope.</p>

<p class="hang1">I see his marvelous advance in the rapid acquisition of knowledge
and acquirement of things material, and attainment in the higher
pursuits of life, with his face fixed upon that light which shineth
brighter and brighter unto the perfect day.</p>

<p class="hang1">I see him who was once deemed stricken, smitten of God, and
afflicted, now entering with universal welcome into the patrimony
of mankind, and I look calmly upon the centuries of blood and tears
and travail of soul, and am satisfied.</p></div>

<h4><i>III. Charles H. Conner</i></h4>

<p>As a companion piece to this litany and this vision I will present
another vision that for calm, clear beauty of style takes us immediately
back<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_210" id="page_210">{210}</a></span> to <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i>. The author calls it a sermonette, and it
is one of three contained in a very small book entitled <i>The Enchanted
Valley</i>. But the author is no preacher. He is a ship-yard worker in
Philadelphia&mdash;I almost said a “common” worker. But such workmen were
never common, anywhere, at any time. Charles Conner wears the garb and
wields the tools of a common workman, but he has most uncommon visions.
He is a seer and a philosopher. He has informed me that there is
American Indian blood in his veins. From the mystical and philosophical
character of his writings, both prose and verse, I should have expected
an East Indian strain. Twice have I visited his humble habitation, and
each time it was a visit to the Enchanted Valley.</p>

<p>His ears caught the medley of sounds, that awoke innumerable echoes; and
with the balmy air peopled the valley with delights. How he came there,
or why, he knew not; nor scarcely thought or cared.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>As he gazed upon the multitude of things, in his heart upsprung desire;
and he gathered the treasures that lay around, till his arms were full,
and his body decked in all their bright array.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>Then the sun went down behind the hill; and the vale grew dark; and the
night air chill; and the place grew solemn, silent, still.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>A new thing then, to mortal ken, seemed hovering on the threshold near.
A strange, fantastic thing, it crept, intangible, nearer, nearer swept,
the pallid, startling face of Fear!</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>But, the night brings sleep at last&mdash;and dreams; and day follows night;
and sunshine follows storm throughout the length of days. But a trace of
the dreams remains, like the faintly clinging scent that marks a hidden
trail; and so, because of his dreams, the man’s desire reached out, and
scaled the lofty peaks that walled him in.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>His pleasant valley seemed too narrow and confined.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_212" id="page_212">{212}</a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>So, with his treasures fondly pressed to his beating heart, he tried to
scale the heights.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>He scrambled and struggled with might and main, slipped and arose; and
fell again and again. The spirit was willing, and valiant, and brave;
but the treasure encumbered it with fatal hold; and held him bound, as
with fold on fold a corpse is held in its lowly grave. So, try as he
might, he could not rise much higher than one’s hands can reach; and one
by one, his gathered treasures lost their brightness and their charm; as
gathered flowers wilt and fade; and his arms weary from the burden that
they bore, let fall and scattered lie, little by little, more and more
of the things he had gathered and vainly prized. And each thing lost was
so much lightness gained, enabling him to mount a little higher up the
rugged steep. And so it was till night was come again at last; and worn
and weary, he sank down to sleep and rest.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>And, as he slept, his arms relaxed their hold; and down the steep his
dwindling treasures rolled, till the last of them found their natural
level and resting place, the lower stretch of ground. ’Twas then a
strange sight met my gaze, long to be remembered in the coming days of
trial and endeavor.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>From out that sleeping form a luminous haze arose, airy and white; and
glowed within it an amber fire, as it mounted higher, higher; and, as it
arose, it had the appearance of a man; and its countenance was the
countenance of him that slept. Thus up and up it winged its flight,
until above the highest peak ’twas lost to sight. I pondered the matter
in wonder and awe, until long<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_213" id="page_213">{213}</a></span> past the midnight hour, how that a soul
at last gained its longed for power to win the distant height.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>There is a kingdom of earth, and of water and of air.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>Each has its own. The heavier cannot rise above its level, to the next
and lighter zone.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>The treasures of the soul’s desire, were treasures of earth, whose
lightest joys were too heavy and too gross to be sustained in the finer,
rarer atmosphere; and thus were as a leaden weight that anchored the
soul to earth, without its being at all aware that the things it thought
so pleasant and so fair, were shackles to bind it hard and fast; and
make it impossible for it to gain the region that instinctively it felt
and knew was the rightful place of its abode.</p>

<h4><i>IV. William Edgar Bailey</i></h4>

<p>Yet one more prose-poem I will give, as a sort of coda to the series. It
is taken from a paper-covered booklet entitled <i>The Firstling</i>, by
William Edgar Bailey, from which <i>The Slump</i>, on page 65, was taken:</p>

<p class="cpom">TO A WILD ROSE</p>

<p>The wild rose silently peeps from its uncouth habitation, thrives and
flourishes in its glory; its fragrant bud bows to sip the nectar of the
morning. Its delicate blossom blushes in the balmy breeze as the wind
tells its tale of adoration. Performing well its part, it withers<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_214" id="page_214">{214}</a></span> and
decays; the chirping sparrow perches serenely on its boughs, only to
find it wrapped in sadness and solemnity&mdash;yet its grief-stained leaf and
weather beaten branches silently chant euphonic choruses in natural
song, in solemn commemoration of its faded splendor.</p>

<p>Dead, yes dead&mdash;but in thy hibernal demise dost thou bequeath a truth
eternal as the stars. I saw thee, Rose, when the elf of spring hung thy
floral firstling upon that thorny bower and robed thy ungainly form in a
garb of green, and, Rose, thou wert sweet!</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>I saw the same vernal sprite pay homage to thy highbrowed kinsman in
yonder stench-bestifled dell, and, in his pause of an instant, baptized
its sacred being in the same aromatic blood. I saw thee, Rose, in thy
autumnal desolation, when the Storm-God was wont to do thee harm, laid
waste thy foliage, and cast at thy feet, as a challenge, his mantle of
snow, and the Law of Non-resistance was still unbroken.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>Tell me thy story, Rose! Do the stars in their unweary watch breathe
forth upon thee a special benediction from the sky? Or did the wind waft
a drop of blood from the Cross to thy dell to sanctify thy being? Oh,
leave me not, thou Redeemer of the Woods, to plod the way alone! My
Nazarene, grant but to me a double portion of thy humble pride&mdash;and in
my tearful grief permit thou me to pluck a fragrant thought from thy
thorny bosom!</p>

<h4><i>V. R. Nathaniel Dett</i></h4>

<p>Primarily a composer and pianist, Mr. Dett exemplifies the close kinship
of poetry and music,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_215" id="page_215">{215}</a></span> for in the former art as well as in the latter he
exhibits a finely creative spirit. To speak first of his compositions
for the piano, the following works are widely known and greatly admired
by lovers of music: “Magnolia Suite,” “In the Bottoms Suite,” “Listen to
the Lambs,” “Marche Negre,” “Arietta,” “Magic Song,” “Open Yo’ Eyes,”
and “Hampton, My Home by the Sea.” Mr. Dett took a degree in music at
Oberlin Conservatory of Music, and a Harvard prize in music (1920). The
musical endowment for which his race is celebrated is cultured and
refined in him and guided by science. The basis of his brilliant
compositions is to be found in the folk melodies of his people. The
musical genius of his people expresses itself through him with
conscious, perfected art. To sit under the spell of his performance of
his own pieces is to acquire a new idea of the Negro people.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">R. Nathaniel Dett</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The same refined and exalted spirit reveals itself in Mr. Dett’s verse
as in his music. Having<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_216" id="page_216">{216}</a></span> this combination of gifts, he cannot but raise
the highest expectations. I present in this place a poem in blank verse
of nobly contemplative mood, suggesting far more, as the best poems do,
than it says:</p>

<p class="cpom">AT NIAGARA</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;No, no! Not tonight, my Friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I may not, cannot go with you tonight.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And think not that I love you any less<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Because this now I’d rather be alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My heart is strangely torn; unwonted thoughts<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Have so infused themselves into my mind<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That altogether there is wrought in me<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A sort of hapless mood, whose phantom power<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Born perhaps of my own fantasies<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Has ta’en me. By its subtle spell<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I’m wooed and changed from what’s my natural self.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I am so possessed I can but wish<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For nothing else save this and solitude.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If in companionship I sought relief<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yours indeed would be the first I’d seek.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There is none other whom I so esteem,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">None who quite so perfect understands.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Your presence always is a soothing balm,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&mdash;Ne’er failing me when troubled. But tonight,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Forgive me, Friend&mdash;I’d rather be alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Leave me, let me with myself commune.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Presently if no change come, I shall go<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Stand in the shadowed gorge, or where the moon<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Throws her silver on the rippling stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">List to the sounding cataract’s thundering fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or hark to spirit voices in the wind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_217" id="page_217">{217}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">For methinks sometimes that these strange moods<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Are heaven-sent us by the jealous God<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who’d thus remind us that no human love<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Can fully satisfy the longing heart:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Perhaps an intimation sent to souls<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That he would speak somewhat, or nearer draw.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Therefore I’ll to Him. Talking waters, stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The moon and whispering trees shall make me wise<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In what it is He’d have my spirit know.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Nature singing from the earth and sky<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shall fill me with such peace, that in the morn<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I’ll be the gay glad self you’ve always known.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Urge me no further, now you understand.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A nobler friend than you none ever knew&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But not this time. Tonight I’ll be alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And if from moonlit valley God should speak,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or in the tumbling waters sound a call,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or whisper in the sighing of the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He’ll find me with an undivided heart<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Patient waiting to hear; but Friend,&mdash;alone.<br /></span>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI<br /><br />
<small>DIALECT VERSE</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> reader of these pages may ask: “But where is the Negro’s humorous
verse? Here is the pathos, where is the comedy of Negro life?” It may
also be asked where the dialect verse is, and the dramatic narratives
and character pieces that made Dunbar famous.</p>

<p>The present-day Negro poets do not, as has been asserted, spurn dialect.
Many of them have given a portion of their pages to character pieces in
dialect, humorous in effect. Whether those who have excluded such pieces
from their books have done so on principle or not I cannot say. In
general, however, these writers are too deeply earnest for dialect
verse, and the “broken tongue” is too suggestive of broken bodies and
servile souls. But by those who have employed dialect its uses and
effects have been well understood. Dialect, as is proven by Burns,
Lowell, Riley, Dunbar, often gets nearer the heart than the language of
the schools is able to do, and for home-spun philosophy, for mother-wit,
for folk-lore, and for racial humor, for whatever is quaint and peculiar
and native in any people, it is the only proper medium. Poets of the
finest art from Theocritus to Tenny<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_219" id="page_219">{219}</a></span>son have so used it. Genius here as
elsewhere will direct the born poet and instruct him when to use dialect
and when the language that centuries of tradition have refined and
standardized and encrusted with poetic associations. There is a world of
poetic wealth in the strangely naïve heart of the rough-schooled Negro
for which the smooth-worn, disconsonanted language of the cabin and the
field is beautifully appropriate. There is also another world of poetic
wealth in the Negro of culture for which only the language of culture is
adequate. To such we must say: “All things are yours.”</p>

<p>While, as remarked, many Negro verse-writers have used dialect
occasionally, in the ways indicated, Waverley Turner Carmichael has made
it practically his one instrument of expression in his little book
entitled <i>From the Heart of a Folk</i>. A representative piece is the
following:</p>

<p class="cpom">MAMMY’S BABY SCARED</p>

<p>Carmichael was born at Snow Hill, Alabama, and in the Industrial
Institute there received the rudiments of an education, which was added
to by a summer term at Harvard. Since the book mentioned I have seen
nothing from his pen.</p>

<p>The elder Cotter in <i>A White Song and a Black Song</i> gives us in the
second part several dialect pieces in the most successful manner.
Several are satirical, like the following:</p>

<p>Two poems by Sterling M. Means, one in standard English and one in
dialect may well be placed here side by side for comparison as being
identical in theme and feeling, and differing but in manner. They are
taken from his book entitled <i>The Deserted Cabin and Other Poems</i>:</p>

<p>J. Mord Allen’s poems and tales in dialect are worthy of distinction.
They are executed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_224" id="page_224">{224}</a></span> the true spirit of art. I should rank his book,
elsewhere named, as one of the few best the Negro has contributed to

<p>James Weldon Johnson entitled a section of his book <i>Jingles and
Croons</i>. Among these pieces, so disparagingly designated, are to be
found some of the best dialect writing in the whole range of Negro
literature. Every quality of excellence is there. The one piece I give
is perhaps not above the average of a score in his book:</p>

<p>Numerous other writers would furnish quite as good specimens of
dialectical verse as those given. This medium of artistic expression is
not being neglected, it is only made secondary and, as it were,
incidental. By perhaps half of the poets it is not used. With a few, and
they of no little<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_228" id="page_228">{228}</a></span> talent, it is the main medium. Among this few,
Carmichael has been named; S. Jonathan Clark, of Dublin, Mississippi,
and Theodore Henry Shackelford, of Jamaica Plains, New York, are others.</p>

</div>

<p>Shackelford, with little schooling, displays a versatility of talent.
His own pen has illustrated with interesting realistic sketches his book
entitled <i>My Country and Other Poems</i>, and for some of his lyrics he has
written music. A large proportion of his pieces are in dialect, much in
the spirit of Dunbar. His best productions in standard English are
ballads. He tells a tale in verse with Wordsworthian simplicity and
feeling. Mr. Clark is a school principal, with the education that
implies. He has not yet published a book.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_229" id="page_229">{229}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> elsewhere intimated there is being produced in America a literature
of which America, as the term is commonly understood, is not aware. It
is a literature of protest&mdash;protest sometimes pathetic and prayerful,
sometimes vehement and bitter. It comes from Negro writers, in prose and
verse, in the various forms of fiction, drama, essay, editorial, and
lyric. It is only with the lyric form that we are here concerned. Of
that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_230" id="page_230">{230}</a></span> we shall make a special presentation, in this chapter.</p>

<p>An artistic and restrained expression of the protest against irrational
color prejudice, in the plaintive, pathetic key, is found in the
following free-verse poem by Winston Allen:</p>

<p class="cpom">THE BLACK VIOLINIST</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I touched the violin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, whose hand was black,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I touched the violin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a grand salon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I touched the violin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a Russian palace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I touched the violin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dream-born strains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chanted by the Congo<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soared to Heaven’s chambers.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Could I touch the violin?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, whose hand was black?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bring to life dream music?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men had taunted me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Age-worn months: their jeers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snapped to bits my heartstrings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snapped my inner soul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sting of living<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tortured me the livelong day.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Sometimes the protest runs in a lighter vein&mdash;as thus, in verses
entitled:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_231" id="page_231">{231}</a></span></p>

<p class="cpom">OLD JIM CROW</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wherever we live, it’s right to forgive,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It’s wrong to hold malice, we know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But there’s one thing that’s true, from all points of view,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All Negroes hate old man Jim Crow.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His home is in hell; he loves here to dwell;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We meet him wherever we go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all public places, where live both the races,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You’ll always see Mr. Jim Crow.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Be we well educated, even to genius related,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We may have a big pile of dough,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That cuts not a figger, you still are a nigger,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And that is the law with Jim Crow.<br /></span>
<span class="i8"><i>The Nashville Eye.</i><br /></span>

</div>

<p>But the Negro is seldom humorous these days on the subject of racial
discriminations. Occasionally, in dialect verse, he still makes merry
with the foibles or over-accentuated traits of certain types of the
Negro. In general, however, the Negro verse-smith goes to his work with
a grim aspect. He is there to smite. Sometimes the anvil clangs, more
mightily than musically. But there is precedent.</p>

<p>A stanza each from two poems somewhat intense will serve to show the
character of much verse in Negro newspapers. The first is from verses
entitled “Sympathy,” by Tilford Jones:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_232" id="page_232">{232}</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mourn for the thousands slain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The youthful and the strong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mourn for the last; but pray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For those hung by the mobbing throng.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pray to our God above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To break the fell destroyer’s sway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And show His saving love.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The second is the last stanza of a poem entitled <i>Shall Race Hatred
Prevail?</i> by Adeline Carter Watson.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">By the tears of Negro mothers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the woes of Negro wives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the sighs of Negro children,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By your gallant snuffed-out lives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the throne of God eternal;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Standing hard by Heaven’s gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye shall crush this cursed, infernal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Western stigma: groundless hate!<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The following two poems have a world of pathos for every reflecting
person, in the unanswered question of each. The first is by Mrs. Georgia
Douglas Johnson:</p>

<p class="cpom">TO MY SON</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Shall I say, “My son, you are branded in this country’s pageantry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foully tethered, bound forever, and no forum makes you free?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall I mark the young light fading through your soul-enchanneled eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the dusky pall of shadows screen the highway of your sky?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_233" id="page_233">{233}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or shall I with love prophetic bid you dauntlessly arise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spurn the handicap that binds you, taking what the world denies?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bid you storm the sullen fortress built by prejudice and wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a faith that shall not falter in your heart and on your tongue!<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The second is by Will Sexton:</p>

<p class="cpom">TO MY LOST CHILD</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It is well, child of my heart, the rosebush drops its petals on your grave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is well, child of my heart, the sparrow sings to you when Aurora has rouged the sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In your trundle bed deep in the bosom of the earth you can dream pleasanter dreams than I.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You have never felt the sting of living in a white man’s civilization and beneath a white man’s laws.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You have never been forced to dance to the music of hate played by an idle orchestra.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You have never toiled long hours and bowed and scraped for the chance to breathe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In your dreams you wonder in the Heaven beyond the skies with the God civilization rebukes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell me, little child, are you not happy in that realm no white man can enter?<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In much of this utterance of protest, this arraignment of the white
man’s civilization that rebukes God, there may be more passion than
poesy. But out of such passion, as it were a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_234" id="page_234">{234}</a></span> rumbling of thunder, the
lightning will one day leap. A poet born and reared in South Carolina,
Joshua Henry Jones, Jr., appeals from man’s inhumanities to God’s
prevailing power in passionate stanzas of which this is the first, the
rest being like:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They’ve lynched a man in Dixie.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O God, behold the crime.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And midst the mad mob’s howling<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How sweet the church bells chime!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They’ve lynched a man in Dixie.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You say this cannot be?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See where his lead-torn body<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mute hangs from yonder tree.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>This or a similar lynching provoked the following lines from another,
Walter Everette Hawkins, in a poem entitled <i>A Festival in Christendom</i>.
After relating that the white people of a certain community were on
their way to church on the Sabbath day, the poem continues:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And so this Christian mob did turn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From prayer to rob, to lynch and burn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A victim helplessly he fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tortures truly kin to hell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They bound him fast and strung him high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They cut him down lest he should die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before their energy was spent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In torturing to their heart’s content.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_235" id="page_235">{235}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">They tore his flesh and broke his bones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laughed in triumph at his groans;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They chopped his fingers, clipped his ears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And passed them round as souvenirs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They bored hot irons in his side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And reveled in their zeal and pride;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They cut his quivering flesh away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And danced and sang as Christians may;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then from his side they tore his heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And watched its quivering fibres dart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then upon his mangled frame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They piled the wood, the oil and flame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest there be left one of his creed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One to perpetuate his breed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest there be one to bear his name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or build the stock from which he came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They dragged his bride up to the pyre<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And plunged her headlong in the fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full-freighted with an unborn child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hot embers on her form they piled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they raised a Sabbath song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The echo sounded wild and strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A benediction to the skies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That crowned the human sacrifice.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Few are the poets quoted or mentioned in this volume who have not
contributed to this literature of protest. James Weldon Johnson, whose
predominant motive is artistic creation, affords more than one poem in
which the note of protest is sounded in pathos. Pathos is indeed the
characteristic note of the great body of Negro verse. Aided by the two
preceding extracts to an under<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_236" id="page_236">{236}</a></span>standing of Johnson’s point of view, the
reader will appreciate the following poem, remarkable for that restraint
which adds to the potency of art:</p>

<p class="cpom">THE BLACK MAMMY</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O whitened head entwined with turban gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O kind black face, O crude, but tender hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O foster-mother in whose arms there lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The race whose sons are masters of the land!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was thine arms that sheltered in their fold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was thine eyes that followed through the length<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of infant days these sons. In times of old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was thy breast that nourished them to strength.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So often hast thou to thy bosom pressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The golden head, the face and brow of snow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So often has it ’gainst thy broad, dark breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lain, set off like a quickened cameo.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou simple soul, as cuddling down that babe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With thy sweet croon, so plaintive and so wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came ne’er the thought to thee, swift like a stab,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That it some day might crush thine own black child?<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>There died in Fort McHenry hospital, February, 2, 1921, a soldier-poet
of the Negro race, who had been called “the poet laureate of the New
Negro,” his name Lucian B. Watkins. He deserved the title, whatever may
be the exact definition of “the New Negro.” For in his lyrics, of many
forms, racial consciousness reached a degree of intensity to which only
a disciplined<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_237" id="page_237">{237}</a></span> sense of art set a limit.&mdash;He was born in a cabin at
Chesterfield, Virginia, struggled in the usual way for the rudiments of
book-knowledge, became a teacher, then a soldier. His health was wrecked
in the World War. He died before his powers were matured.&mdash;Short and
simple are the annals of the poet. Before one of his intenser race poems
I shall give his last lyric cry, uttered but a few days before his
lingering death:</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>The following sonnet, entitled “The New Negro,” will serve to represent
much of Watkins’s verse:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He thinks in black. His God is but the same<br /></span>
<span class="i0">John saw&mdash;with hair “like wool” and eyes “as fire”&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who makes the visions for which men aspire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His kin is Jesus and the Christ who came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Humbly to earth and wrought His hallowed aim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Midst human scorn. Pure is his heart’s desire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His life’s religion lifts; his faith leads higher.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love is his Church, and Union is its name.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lo, he has learned his own immortal rôle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this momentous drama of the hour;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has read aright the heavens’ Scriptural scroll<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Bove ancient wrong&mdash;long boasting in its tower.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, he has sensed the truth. Deep in his soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He feels the manly majesty of power.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The protest not infrequently takes the form of entreaty and appeal,
sometimes the form of an invocation of divine wrath upon the doers of
evil. The following poem from Watkins, unique and effective in form and
biblical phrasing, is the kind of appeal that will not out of the mind:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_239" id="page_239">{239}</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Hawkins, whom I have quoted, entitled his book <i>Chords and
Discords</i>. What did he mean by “discords”? Perhaps a disparagement of
his muse’s efforts at music. Perhaps, and rather, something in the
content, for the contrasts are sharp, the tones are piercing. These
“discords” abound in contemporary Negro verse. Between the octave and
the sestet of the following sonnet, by Mrs. Carrie W. Clifford, the
discord is of the kind that stabs you:</p>

<p>The Negro’s deep resentment of his wrongs has found its most artistic
expression in the verse of a poet who came to us from Jamaica&mdash;Mr.
Claude McKay. In another chapter I have given the reader an opportunity
to judge of his merits. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_241" id="page_241">{241}</a></span> will be represented here by a sonnet,
written, I believe, shortly after the race-riot in the national capital,
July, 1919. It has been widely reprinted in the Negro newspapers.</p>

<p>Race consciousness has recently attained an extraordinary pitch in the
Negro, and there seems to be no prospect of any abatement. The
verse-smiths one and all have borne witness to a feeling of great
intensity on all subjects pertaining to their race&mdash;the discriminations
and injustices practised against it, the limitations that would be
imposed upon it, the contumelies that would offend it. Ardent appeals
are therefore made to race pride and ardent exhortations to race unity.
The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_242" id="page_242">{242}</a></span> ancient rôle of the poet whereby he is identified with the prophet
is being resumed by the enkindled souls of black men. With their natural
gift for music and eloquence, with their increasing culture, with their
building up of a poetic tradition now in process, with this
intensification of race consciousness, almost anything may be expected
of the Negro in another generation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_243" id="page_243">{243}</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Altogether</span> admirable is the disposition of Negro verse-writers to
eulogize the notable personages of their race, the men and women who
have blazed the trail of advance. The mention of Attucks, Black Sampson,
Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman, and others like these, all practically
unknown to white readers, is frequent, and reverential odes and sonnets
to Douglass, Toussaint L’Ouverture, Washington, Dunbar, are many and
enthusiastic. Here as elsewhere, however, I refrain from giving mere
titles and from comments on productions merely cited. The reader will
find such poems as I allude to in every poet’s volume.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_244" id="page_244">{244}</a></span> I refer to this
body of eulogistic verse only to suggest to the reader who takes up the
writings of the American Negroes that he will learn that they have a
heritage of heroic traditions from which poetry springs in every race.</p>

<p>Instead of giving here such specimens of poetic eulogy as I have alluded
to, however, I shall give a few poems of a more general significance,
poems of appeal or tribute to the entire black race or poems of
affectionate tribute to individuals. A free-verse poem entitled “The
Negro,” by Mr. Langston Hughes, on page 200, may be recalled. Here is a
sonnet with the same title, by Mr. McKay, which appeared in <i>The
People’s Pilot</i>, published in Richmond, Va.:</p>

<p>From another Virginia magazine, also now defunct, <i>The Praiseworthy

Jr.:</p>

<p>In spirit and in form both these productions seem to be quite
noteworthy. The first has in it something darkly and terribly ominous,
while the second has all the fervor of religion in its youth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_246" id="page_246">{246}</a></span> The class
of poems to follow will afford a contrast. They will bear witness to
that pride of race, perhaps, which we of the white race have commended
to the colored people:</p>

<p>I will conclude this section with a very well rhymed tribute to two
Negro bards between whom there was a friendship and a correspondence
similar to that which existed between Burns and Lapraik. The writer,
James Edgar French, was a native of Kentucky, studied for the ministry,
and died early:</p>

<p class="cpom">DUNBAR AND COTTER</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dunbar and Cotter! foster-brothers, ye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nurst at the breast of heav’nly minstrelsy!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first two Negroes who have dared to climb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Parnassus’ mount, and carve your names in rhyme;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_254" id="page_254">{254}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, over icy walls of prejudice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where twice ten thousand gorgon monsters hiss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did scale the peak and make the steep ascent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For which great feat ye had small precedent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There were who said: “The Negro is not fit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To write good prose, much less to rhyme with wit”;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That nothing ever Negroes could inspire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Spenser’s fancy or with Shakespere’s fire:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Dryden’s vigor, with the ease of Pope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To weave the iambic pentametric rope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ye, immortal sons of Afric, ye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have proved these charges gross absurdity;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That old Dame Nature’s no respecter in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Regard to person or the hue of skin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Omnific God, at whose fiatic hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did primogenial light deluge the land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose word supreme did out of chaos draw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A world, and order made its guiding law,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bequeath’d like talents to the black and white;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To read form’d some and others made to write;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To govern these, and those to governed be,<br /></span>

<h4><i>II. Commemorative and Occasional</i></h4>

<p>From this body of Negro verse which I have been describing and giving
specimens of may be selected pieces commemorative of days and seasons
that are quite up to the standard of similar pieces provided for white
children in their school-readers. These selections will further
illustrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_255" id="page_255">{255}</a></span> the variety of themes and emotional responses in this body
of contemporary verse.</p>

<p>The first selection hardly needs any allowance to be made for it, I
think, on the score that it was written by a girl only sixteen years of
age:</p>

<p>If the reader is disposed to make comparisons he might recall, without
very great detriment to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_256" id="page_256">{256}</a></span> the following poem, Tennyson’s famous stanzas
on the same theme. It is in the effective manner of the poems already

<p>I will conclude this anthology with a selection from our Madagascar
poet, Andrea Razafkeriefo, which, in a happy strain, conveys a very good
philosophy of life&mdash;which is especially the Afro-American’s:</p>

<p class="cpom">RAINY DAYS</p>

<span class="i2">But slip into my rocking chair;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The pitter-patter of the rain<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The lightning’s flash, the thunder’s peal<br /></span>

<p>Of the manifold and immense significance of poetry as a form of
spiritual expression the Negro American has lately become profoundly
aware, as this presentation must amply reveal. Not only the industrial
arts are the objects of his ambition, according to the far-looking
doctrine of Tuskegee, but as well those arts which are born of and
express the spiritual traits of mankind, the fine arts&mdash;music, painting,
sculpture, dramatics, and poetry. In them all the Negro is winning
distinction. In consequence it would seem that there must dawn upon us,
shaped by the poems of this collection, a new vision of the Negro and a
new appreciation of his spiritual qualities, his human character. A
profounder human sympathy with a greatly hampered, handicapped, and
humiliated people must also ensue from such considerations as these
poems will induce. One of the poets here represented cries out, as if
from a calvary, “We come slow-struggling up the hills of Hell.” Another,
in milder but not less appealing tone, cries: “We climb the slopes of
life with throbbing hearts.”</p>

<p>This appeal, expressed or implicit throughout the entire range of
present-day Negro verse, an appeal sometimes angrily, sometimes
plaintively<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_265" id="page_265">{265}</a></span> uttered, an appeal to mankind for fundamental justice and
for human fellowship on the broad basis of kinship of spirit, may
